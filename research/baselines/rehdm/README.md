# Faithful ReHDM baseline

Self-contained reproduction of **ReHDM** (Li et al., *Beyond Individual and
Point: Next POI Recommendation via Region-aware Dynamic Hypergraph with
Dual-level Modeling*, IJCAI 2025) adapted to the next-region task on Gowalla
state-level check-ins.

## What "faithful" means here

This baseline reproduces the published architecture and preprocessing
pipeline. It does **not** consume any in-house Check2HGI / HGI substrate.
Inputs are derived from raw Gowalla check-ins and US Census TIGER tracts,
matching paper §4.1 / §5.1.

The **only** deviation from the published model is the predictor's output
domain: paper predicts next-POI (~10 K candidates); we project to
`n_regions` (≈1.1 K on AL, ≈1.5 K on AZ, ≈4.7 K on FL) so the result is
directly comparable to the check2HGI study's region-task table. Inputs and
the hypergraph machinery are unchanged.

A future variant will keep the paper's POI head and feed it the in-house
Check2HGI embeddings (single-task region head for embedding-based runs).

## Components

- `etl.py` — raw check-ins → 6 ID encodings + 24h trajectories +
  TIGER-tract region targets.
- `model.py` — `ReHDM` module: 6-ID embedding, POI-level Transformer,
  vertex→hyperedge then L−1 hyperedge↔hyperedge HG-Transformer layers with
  intra/inter edge types and gated residual; classifier projects to
  `n_regions`.
- `train.py` — repeated-seed run trainer (default 5 seeds × 50 epochs),
  AdamW + OneCycleLR, sub-hypergraph built per batch with intra-user and
  shared-POI inter-user collaborators that satisfy `end(s_m) < start(target)`.

## Faithfulness notes

| ReHDM paper | This implementation |
|---|---|
| 6 ID features `<u, p, c, h_h, t_d, r>` | identical (user/poi/category/hour/day-of-week/quadkey-L10) |
| Quadkey level 10 | configurable, default 10 |
| 24h trajectories, ≥2 check-ins | identical |
| Chronological 80/10/10, val/test ⊆ train users+POIs | identical |
| POI-level: 1× Transformer block, **target trajectory only** | identical; collaborators keep raw `E(q)` embeddings until the V→E stage (§4.3, fixed 2026-07 — see A3) |
| Trajectory-level: vertex→hyperedge then L−1 hyperedge↔hyperedge layers | identical, default L=2 |
| Edge types `r ∈ {intra, inter}` | identical (learned 2-row embedding) |
| Message `m_ij = h_j + r_ij + t_ij + s_ij` (Eq. 9) | `t_ij`/`s_ij` = bucketed log-Δt / haversine log-Δd → learned embeddings (restored 2026-07 — see A2; **verify-needed** on encoder family / bucket widths) |
| Time-precedence filter on collaborators | enforced (`end(s_m) < start(target)`) |
| Gated residual `β h_l W + (1−β) g_l` | identical (β=0.5 default) |
| V→E hidden state L2-normalised (Eq. 13) | identical (`F.normalize`); the e2e `Norm` (Eq. 14, ambiguous) is **LayerNorm** here (documented choice, see A4) |
| Predictor: linear → softmax over POIs | **adapted** to softmax over regions |
| Cross-entropy training | identical |

## Paper ambiguities (documented faithful guesses)

The paper does not specify the following; we picked defensible defaults:

| Item | Paper | Default here |
|---|---|---|
| Inter-user "≈" similarity | undefined | shared-POI ≥ 1, random-sample to `max_inter` (MSTHgL / DCHL convention) |
| L (number of e2e layers) | unstated | 2 (i.e. one e2e layer) |
| β (gated residual) | unstated | 0.5 |
| d_id (per-feature embedding) | unstated | 32 (⇒ d=192) |
| Optimizer / lr / batch / epochs | unstated | AdamW (lr 5e-5, wd 0.01) + OneCycleLR (max_lr 5e-4), batch 64, 50 ep (argparse defaults) |
| Eq. 14 `Norm` | LN or L2 | **LayerNorm** at the e2e stage (stability at large region domains); V→E is L2 per Eq. 13 |
| `t_ij` / `s_ij` encoder + bucketization | unspecified (ambiguity #4) | log-width buckets (32 each) on Δt / haversine Δd → `nn.Embedding` (STHGCN-style; verify-needed) |
| Sub-hypergraph collaborator cap | unstated | `max_intra=4, max_inter=4` |
| Quadkey vocab encoding | "modulo grid count" | string-vocab indexing (equivalent for hashing) |

## Verified-fixed bugs (caught in audit pass)

1. Spatial join did not preserve sort order → re-sort after merge.
2. Target check-in was fed into the encoder (region label leakage) →
   encoder now only sees the first `t_len-1` check-ins; target is the
   region of position `t_len`.
3. Eval-time inter-user shuffle was non-deterministic across calls →
   stable RNG seeded with 0 during evaluation. (Re-fixed 2026-07 — A6: the seed
   was previously keyed off `training`, so the eval path (which passes
   `training=True` to build the sub-hypergraph) silently used the global RNG.
   `make_collate(..., seeded=True)` now decouples the two.)

## AMP / precision (A1)

bf16 autocast is gated by `REHDM_DISABLE_AMP` (`1` = force fp32, `0` = force
bf16, unset = auto: fp32 when `n_regions > REHDM_AMP_REGION_CAP`, default 3000).
Rationale: the A40 grad-NaNs on bf16 backward at large region domains (FL/CA/TX),
which the NaN guards would silently absorb. The per-run skipped-batch count is
logged into the result JSON (`skipped_batches`) so a NaN storm is visible. Under
the fp32 path TF32 is also disabled (true-fp32 numerics; see B4).
