# v18 REGENERATION — the autonomous top-level driver. Runs wave seed 0 then wave seed 1 to n=10,
# under the author-approved recipe in FINAL_SETTINGS.md.
#
#   bash docs/studies/closing_data/v18/run_regen.sh            # seeds 0 1 (default)
#   SEEDS="0 1 7 100" bash .../run_regen.sh                    # full n=20
#
# DESIGN GOALS (author: "as autonomous as possible, we just monitor status")
#   - Resumable: any cell with a sidecar is SKIPPED loudly. Safe to kill and relaunch at any time.
#   - Self-healing: a failed cell does not stop the wave; it is recorded and RETRIED once at the end
#     of the wave, then left as failed for a human.
#   - Health-guarded: waits for host RAM before large-state MTL (shared box: neighbours spike to
#     80-100 GB and the kernel OOM-killer has taken innocent jobs before), and ABORTS the wave if
#     free disk falls under a floor rather than filling /home.
#   - Observable without reading logs: status.json + PROGRESS.md + log.md rewritten per cell.
#
# WHAT IS ALREADY DONE AND WILL BE SKIPPED
#   The 10 dedicated-REGION cells are UNCHANGED by the new recipe (region keeps tau=0, because logit
#   adjustment significantly HURTS Acc@10: AL -1.841 p=0.0002, IST -2.749 p<0.0001). Their sidecars
#   were kept and will be skipped. Verified bit-reproducible: today's fresh AL/IST tau=0 arms
#   reproduced the stored 69.9956 / 75.1563 exactly.
#   The 19 cat+joint sidecars used the SUPERSEDED recipe and were moved to
#   docs/results/closing_data/v18_superseded_oldrecipe/ -- they will be regenerated.
#
# PARALLELISM (measured on this box, not guessed)
#   Small states (istanbul, alabama, arizona) run 2-wide: ~1.18x throughput, and the card holds two
#   small jobs comfortably. Large states (florida, texas, california) run STRICTLY 1-wide -- their
#   MTL dataset build peaks ~66 GB host RAM and 2-wide is recorded as infeasible there. Concurrency
#   never changes a cell's numbers (each run is independently seeded and deterministic); it only
#   changes wall time. That policy lives in run_wave.sh and is unchanged here.
