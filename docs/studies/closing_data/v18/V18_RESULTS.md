# v18 — RESULTS

> Generated 2026-08-11T01:56:26.973027+00:00 from [`data/v18_results.json`](data/v18_results.json) by `make_results.py`. Every number here is traceable to that JSON, which [`score_all.py`](score_all.py) regenerates from the rundirs.

**v18 = the frozen v17 recipe on a leak-free substrate**: the consecutive-visit graph is forward-only in training and at readout, plus 4 elapsed-time node columns (`in_channels` 15). Not an architecture change. See [`METHODOLOGY.md`](METHODOLOGY.md).

## Conventions

- **diag-best** (`db_*`) — per-task diagnostic-best epochs. The Table-3 convention.
- **joint-best** (`jb_*`) — both heads at the single `geom_simple`-selected epoch, `min_best_epoch` 0. What the served checkpoint delivers.
- cat = macro-F1. reg = `top10_acc_indist · (1 − ood_fraction) · 100`, i.e. **Acc@10**.
- "beats" = paired one-sided superiority test. "matches" = TOST non-inferiority within ±2 pp. A non-inferior result is never upgraded to a win.


> ⚠ **Two disclosures that qualify every p-value below.**
>
> **1. The tests pool (seed, fold) pairs as if independent.** `paired_diffs` concatenates the 5 per-fold differences from each seed, so n = seeds × 5. The 5 folds within one seed share ~80 % of their training data, so these are **not** independent replicates and the reported p-values are anti-conservative. At n=10 (2 seeds) the honest independent unit is the **seed**, giving n=2 — underpowered. Read the p-values as descriptive, and do not promote a marginal result on their strength alone.
>
> **2. The dedicated-cat comparator was tuned on this same CV.** Its per-state `max_lr` and the joint `category_weight` were selected at seed 0 on the same 5-fold splits reported here. The dedicated arm got a 4-point per-state LR search while the MTL cat-lr axis was measured null, so the dedicated ceiling is optimistically biased relative to MTL — which makes Δcat a **conservative** estimate of any MTL advantage, and an optimistic one of any MTL deficit. See METHODOLOGY.md.

## 1 · MTL vs its own dedicated ceiling (same substrate, same protocol)

This is the citable contrast: both arms measured on v18, so the comparison is within-protocol.

> The **dedicated** column is restricted to the seeds that also have a joint cell, so Δ, `n` and the p-value all describe the same seeds. A dedicated cell can run ahead of its joint cell (the cheap families are the ones sent to rented hardware), so the all-seed dedicated mean can be based on more seeds than this; it is in `data/v18_results.json` as `stl_cat` / `stl_reg`, against the paired `stl_cat_paired` / `stl_reg_paired` used here.

## 3 · Against the v17 published board — CROSS-SUBSTRATE, descriptive only

> ⚠ v17 and v18 are **different substrates**. These differences are reported to show the size of the leak's contribution; they are **not** superiority tests and must not be written as one.

| state | Δcat v18 | Δcat v17 | shift | Δreg v18 | Δreg v17 | shift |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| istanbul | +0.11 | +8.59 | **-8.48** | +0.11 | +0.28 | -0.17 |
| alabama | -0.08 | +7.72 | **-7.80** | -0.45 | -0.31 | -0.14 |
| arizona | +0.04 | +9.40 | **-9.36** | -0.22 | +0.10 | -0.32 |
| florida | +0.24 | +5.34 | **-5.10** | +0.39 | +0.72 | -0.33 |
| texas | +0.04 | +7.45 | **-7.41** | +1.91 | +2.11 | -0.20 |
| california | +0.12 | +6.45 | **-6.33** | +1.95 | +2.20 | -0.25 |

## 4 · Pooled across states

- **Δcat** pooled over 120 (state, seed, fold) pairs: mean **+0.079** — **beats** (paired one-sided p=0.000)
- **Δreg** pooled over 120 pairs: mean **+0.616** — **beats** (paired one-sided p=0.000)

Pooling across states is reported for a single headline figure; the per-state rows in §1 are the primary result, since the states differ in size and in their v17 deltas.

- [`LOSS_WEIGHT_PROBE.md`](LOSS_WEIGHT_PROBE.md) — the 0.75/0.25 split is **not** a leak artifact and the heads are **orthogonal, not competing** (cos ≈ +0.001). Rebalancing and gradient surgery are both null; the equal split is significantly *harmful* to region at Florida. Keep 0.75/0.25.
