# v18_2 lane runner -- ONE dataset, ONE seed, all three families, fp32.
#
# Runs identically on the A40 and on a Modal H100 container. The point of a single
# script is that the recipe cannot drift between lanes: every hyperparameter below is
# read from the same table the v18 driver used, and precision is pinned, not inherited.
#
#   usage: run_lane.sh <state> <seed> <engine> <v14_dir> <outdir>
#
# PRECISION IS NOT A TUNABLE HERE. CA (8501 region classes) and TX (6553) sit in the
# C~6.5-8.5k band where bf16 backward grad-NaNs and fp16 logits overflow; the resulting
# collapse is SILENT because the per-task best-epoch selector reports the pre-collapse
# peak (archive/lessons/CA_MTL_DIVERGENCE.md). fp32 everywhere.
#
# MTL_STRICT=1 does NOT mean the same thing on all three cells, so do not read it as a
# blanket "abort on non-finite". `guard_finite_step` lives only in mtl_cv.py, so the
# fail-loud non-finite abort applies to the JOINT cell only. On the cat and reg cells the
# same variable instead hard-fails two guards that would otherwise only warn: the torch-build
# check (train.py `_preflight_canon_guards`, fires for every task) and the stride-1 overlap
# provenance check (folds.py `_warn_if_ungated_overlap`). That is a deliberate fail-closed
# choice -- it is stricter than v18/run_wave.sh, which sets MTL_STRICT only on joint -- but it
# is a CRASH surface, not a numerical one. See MODAL_MANUAL.md section 4.

ENVCOMMON="MTL_DISABLE_AMP=1 MTL_STRICT=1"

# ---- MTL_CHUNK_VAL_METRIC, per cell -------------------------------------------------------
# The flag FORCES p1/MTL to accumulate the full val logit on CPU and score it there. It exists as
# an OOM guard: the GPU `torch.cat` of an [N_val x C] logit is ~20 GB at texas overlap scale and
# worse at california. But `_should_chunk_val_metric` ALREADY auto-enables above
# P1_S2_AUTO_BUDGET_GB (default 4 GB), so forcing it adds nothing for a large state and, for a
# SMALL one, pushes a tiny tensor onto the CPU for no reason:
#
#     arizona   N_val=40179  C=1547  -> 0.25 GB  auto-guard would NOT fire
#     florida   N_val=254883 C=4703  -> 4.79 GB  auto-guard fires anyway
#     texas     N_val=766083 C=6553  -> 20.1 GB  auto-guard fires anyway
#
# Measured cost of forcing it: arizona reg took 343 s on a rented H100 against 185 s alone on the
# A40 -- the only family that was SLOWER on faster silicon, because the CPU phase had 8 container
# cores against the A40 box's 32.
#
# EQUIVALENCE IS VERIFIED, NOT ASSUMED. The rank is `1 + #{logits strictly greater}` (an exact
# integer count, device-independent by construction), and the repo's own CPU-vs-CUDA test was
# `skipif(not cuda)` and had therefore never executed. Run on a real T4 on 2026-08-10 over six
# shapes including the arizona and florida val folds and two heavy-exact-tie cases: **worst
# deviation 2.98e-08 across top5/top10/mrr/ndcg/accuracy/f1**, against a reporting precision of
# 1e-4 -- 3350x below the bar. GPU scoring was 3.8-7.6x faster on those shapes.
#
#   reg   -> flag DROPPED; the auto-guard still protects TX/CA. Set P1_FORCE_CPU_VAL=1 to restore.
#   joint -> flag KEPT, exactly as v18/run_wave.sh sets it (mtl_eval.py has its own S2 path; that
#            is a separate question and is deliberately not bundled into this change).
#   cat   -> flag never applied: next_cv.py does not read it, so it was a no-op. Dropped as noise.
# REVERTED 2026-08-10 after measuring on the target card. Keep forcing the CPU path.
#
# The justification for dropping it was that CPU and CUDA scoring are equivalent "by
# construction" because the rank is an exact integer count. That argument is WRONG for the
# metric this cell actually reports: `top10_acc` comes from `_top_k_accuracy`
# (src/tracking/metrics.py:102-110), which uses `logits.topk(k).indices` — and the tie-break AT
# THE K-BOUNDARY is a kernel/arch detail, not the device-independent strict-`>` rank that mrr and
# ndcg use. Measured on an H100 (the card these cells run on):
#
#   continuous-valued logits (all four realistic shapes)  boundary_ties  0.0%   topk_setdiff 0
#                                                          max|Δ| ~1e-9   -> PASS
#   exact ties AT the k-boundary (synthetic worst case)    topk_setdiff 19950/20000
#                                                          top10_acc cpu 0.009850 vs gpu 0.009550
#                                                          Δ = 3.0e-04  -> 300x OVER the 1e-6 bar
#
# So the failure needs an exact fp32 tie at the top-k boundary. It does not occur on continuous
# logits, and p1 evaluates in fp32 (no fp16 quantisation manufacturing ties) — but the rate on
# REAL reg logits is unmeasured, and every banked reg cell in the study was CPU-scored. Mixing
# scoring devices inside one pooled n=20 cell to save ~40 s per small-state cell is a bad trade.
#
# The right fix is not this flag: it is to make p1 stream the val metric ON GPU the way
# mtl_eval.py already does (`_streamed_cls_metrics`, src/tracking/metrics.py), which makes scoring
# homogeneous at ALL scales instead of splitting by size. That belongs at a freeze boundary,
# applied to every state at once — not mid-study. See MODAL_MANUAL.md section 3b-fix.
#
# Set P1_GPU_VAL=1 to opt OUT of the CPU path (only with fresh evidence for your shapes).

# rented cat/reg cell re-pays the full compile -- MODAL_MANUAL section 4's rule, unapplied.
#
# DEFAULT OFF, deliberately. Tying cat/reg to a persistent cache would change how every rented
# cell is produced, including cells another agent is producing right now against cells already
# banked with a cold cache. CLAUDE.md records that a compiled number is governed by the inductor
# session and is within-fold-sigma rather than bit-reproducible, so this is not a protocol
# change -- but it is not nothing either, and it is not a change to make on someone else's
# behalf mid-study. Opt in with INDUCTOR_SHARE_CELLS=1 when you want the amortisation and are

# ---- rundir resolution: ANCHORED TO THE LAUNCHED PID, never newest-mtime -----------------
# MLHistory names every rundir `<prefix>_<timestamp>_<os.getpid()>` (tracking/experiment.py:268),
# and all 22 rundir call sites in the v18 driver family resolve it as `*_${pid}`. run_wave.sh
# states the rule outright: "Rundirs are captured by the launched PID, never by newest-mtime
# globbing (two jobs run concurrently by design)."
#
# This script used to glob `ls -dt ... | head -1`. That is wrong under the packing MODAL_MANUAL
# section 12 recommends -- one job per seed, several jobs sharing one Volume at cwd=/data/repo --
# because two same-state cells then write sibling rundirs under the same prefix and the newest
# one is a race, not an identity. The heartbeat's Volume.commit() makes those writes visible
# across sandboxes, so the race is reachable rather than theoretical: the scorer would score
# another seed's rundir and the sidecar would attest to it.
#
# `env VAR=1 python ...` execs in place, so $! is the python PID -- the same assumption
# run_wave.sh makes.
