# Quick Reference — One-page overview

This is the "TL;DR" page for anyone (human or agent) who needs to get oriented fast. For depth, see `README.md`, `MASTER_PLAN.md`, and the phase docs.

## What we're doing

A clean-slate empirical study of MTLnet on newly-regenerated (bug-fixed) embeddings, organized around ~20 explicit claims. Each claim has a specific test. Every test feeds results back into a central catalog so the paper has evidence-backed statements only.

---

## Phase order

1. **P0** — Prep. Embeddings regenerated, integrity checks, tooling built, sanity run. **~2-4 h**.
2. **P1** — 5 archs × 20 optimizers grid on fusion (AL + AZ). Finds best (arch, optim). **~4-8 h**.
3. **P2** — 9 category × 10 next heads, + MTL vs single-task (critical control for C06). **~8-10 h**.
4. **P3** — Best config on {DGI, HGI, Fusion} + CBIC config on same → proves CBIC's failure was config-specific. **~6-10 h**.
5. **P4** — Hyperparameter sensitivity on the champion. **~7-8 h**.
6. **P5** — Remaining claims, gradient-cosine mechanism, per-category analysis. **~4-6 h**.

**Total:** 36-48 h wall-clock, 5-7 days with parallelism.

## Datasets

- **Alabama** — fast primary (22 min / 5f×50ep run)
- **Arizona** — fast replication (~25 min / run)
- **Florida** — slow heavy validation (~4 h / run)
- Optional: California, Texas, Georgia for external-baseline matching

---

## Key claims (abbreviated)

- **C01** Fusion > HGI-only on champion config
- **C02** Gradient-surgery > equal weight on fusion (at matched batch)
- **C05** Expert gating > FiLM hard sharing
- **C06** MTL > single-task (THE critical control — P2)
- **C11** Embedding quality dominates other choices
- **C12** CBIC's config fails on all embeddings, not just DGI
- **C15-17** Champion is robust to hyperparameters
- **C19-20** Scale imbalance causes source-level gradient conflict (mechanism)

## Coordinator cheat sheet

State lives in `state.json`. Actions (planned `/study` Skill):
- `status` — where are we?
- `next` — run next pending test
- `import <dir>` — archive a result from another machine
- `validate <phase>` — run integrity checks

Integrity contract: `coordinator/integrity_checks.md`.
State schema: `coordinator/state_schema.md`.

## What to do right now (2026-04-14)

1. **Wait for new embeddings.** User is regenerating. No scientific runs until they're ready.
2. **Meanwhile, build P0 tooling:**
   - `scripts/study/validate_inputs.py`
   - `scripts/study/archive_result.py`
   - `scripts/study/launch_test.py`
   - `/study` Skill (min viable)
3. **Once embeddings are ready:** run P0.2 (integrity) + P0.4 (sanity CBIC replication) → if both pass, commit state.json and begin P1.

---

## Exit criteria for each level

- **Phase:** all planned tests have `status ∈ {archived, failed, surprising}` and the gate passes.
- **Study:** all claims have `status ≠ pending` and a new `docs/PAPER_FINDINGS.md` is written.
- **Paper:** draft ready in `articles/BRACIS_2026/` with all claims backed by evidence pointers.

---

## If something surprising happens

1. Coordinator pauses. State.json records an open issue.
2. Human reviews: is this a bug, variance, or a real refutation?
3. If real: append a new C-claim (C22+) with the observation, plan a follow-up test.
4. If bug: fix, re-run, record post-mortem in EXECUTION_LOG.
5. Never silently ignore.

## BRACIS deadline context

- Paper submission: **2026-04-20**
- Today: **2026-04-13**
- Feasible minimum: P0 + P1 + P2 + P3 = ~25-30 h. If parallelized aggressively, can hit BRACIS.
- P4 + P5 go to journal extension if time-constrained.
