# Execution Plan — full-scope "complete the picture, then write" (overlapping-windows ADOPTED)

> Created 2026-06-18. The user's strategic decision: **adopt overlapping windows** (a base change) and
> **execute every open experiment — the overlapping-windows rebuild, Massive-STEPS Phase V, and the new
> external baselines — BEFORE writing**, so the paper rests on the complete picture. This doc is the

## 0 · The discipline (why "do everything" does not mean "a moving target")

"Complete the picture before writing" is the right call for a strong, defensible paper — **but only if the
base is frozen ONCE and the full board runs on that frozen base.** The failure mode is letting a board
result tempt a base change (p-hacking / moving target). The non-negotiable rule:

> Resolve the base-**defining** forks (windowing, recipe via G0.1, baseline set) → **FREEZE one base** →
> run everything on it (champion + STL ceilings + all baselines + Phase V) → **then** write final numbers.
> No P3 training before the freeze. The "full picture" comes from a **complete board on a frozen base**,
> not from iterating the base after seeing results.

The v0 article draft ([`articles/netcore/PAPER_DRAFT_v0.md`](../../articles/netcore/PAPER_DRAFT_v0.md)) locks
**story + structure** now; **all numbers are provisional** and regenerate at the board re-score (M4).

## 1 · The two material corrections (from the adversarial stress-test) — read these first

### 1a · The second-dataset windowing inconsistency is REAL and must be a freeze sub-axis
Massive-STEPS set-(a) **and** the E2 chronological bridge are built on **non-overlapping** window=9
(`second_dataset/STATE.md`, STATS_T1). If the main board adopts overlap, a clean external-validity claim
**cannot pair stride-1 Gowalla against stride-9 Massive-STEPS** — the cat "rising-tide" effect is itself
windowing-driven, so mismatched windowing confounds the transfer claim. The earlier "second_dataset DONE,
off critical path, idle" classification is **wrong under ADOPT.** Two honest options (a freeze decision):
- **(i) Mirror overlap on Massive-STEPS:** rebuild set-(a) sequences + the 25 per-fold priors/city + the E2
  chrono split at stride-1, and **re-prove the E2 leak checks** — note this is a *per-user chronological*
  split, a **more dangerous leak surface** than the user-grouped-CV the overlap memo proved safe (a stride-1
  window near the 80/10/10 boundary can straddle train/val/test). Cost: 2 cities × 2 protocols rebuild + a
  fresh E2 leak re-audit on the CUDA Phase-V box.
- **(ii) Run the external-validity table at NON-overlap on BOTH arms** — keep a non-overlap Gowalla comparand
  specifically for that table, and footnote it. Cheaper; the main-board overlap claim and the
  external-validity claim then live on different (but each internally-matched) windowing.

### 1b · "ADOPT" must be a GATED decision, not a pre-commitment
Overlap is validated at **AL / single-seed / KD-off only**, and the memo itself warns the cat lift is
**scale-dependent** (AL +9.8 pp but FL +1.3 pp at data saturation). Freezing a 6-state board on it before the
evidence exists is a moving-target on the *central* narrative ("overlap strengthens the regime") and a
p-hacking surface on G0.1's binding base. **Honoring the user's ADOPT steer the disciplined way = run the
cheap validation FIRST:** reproduce the overlap effect at **FL + one small/mid state, multi-seed**, and
**re-run the leak audit on the overlapping surface**, *then* sign the base change. This is not
re-litigating the decision — it is de-risking it so the base you freeze is the validated one. **If the
FL/small-state reproduction comes back weak, that is itself a finding to weigh before committing the full
board.**

## 2 · Parallel lanes that are SAFE to start NOW (windowing-independent)

These are the only pre-freeze spends that survive the overlap rebuild:

| Lane | Where | Work | Windowing note |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A — substrate builds** | H100 (metered) | CA + TX v14 builds (measure CA first; overflow TX → A40). **Same machine + fixed seed as the canonical-v14 regeneration** so the build IS the hash anchor (else it's a second non-identical artifact). | Embedding is per-check-in → independent ✓ |
| **B — recipe + base validation** | A40 (free post-R4–R9) | **G0.1-advisory** (AL+FL seed0, current base, fast signal) + the **overlap FL/small-state multi-seed reproduction + leak re-audit** (§1b) | the validation runs are the gate that decides ADOPT |
| **C — baseline CODE** | A40/Mac dev | implement + smoke-test B1 CTLE, B2a POI2Vec, B2b skip-gram, B3 HMT-GRN-style, B4 cascade, B5 Flashback | **code** independent; but see ⚠ below |
| **D — reading lane** | no GPU | B1–B5 triage final sign-off + RUN_MATRIX reconciliation (drafts landed) | fully decoupled ✓ |
| **E — audit fixes** | A40 (light) | emit the v14 **hash manifest**, regenerate ONE canonical v14/state (anchor), rebuild the **stale AL log_T**, wire the shared **freshness-assert utility** into every `--per-fold-transition-dir` consumer | the BLOCKER fix |

> ⚠ **Correction (stress-test):** baseline *code* is windowing-independent, but **B1 CTLE and B2b skip-gram
> pre-train on per-fold train-only sequences** → their pretrain INPUTS (and any cached pretrain artifacts) are
> windowing-dependent and **re-run at the freeze**. Only **B2a POI2Vec** (per-POI embedding) is fully reusable.
> And the C-lane smoke-tests run on the non-overlap base, so they do **not** validate stride-1 behavior
> (causal mask + memory under ~7.5–8.4× more sequences) — budget that the "one re-run" may surface
> OOM/convergence issues at stride-1.

> ⚠ **Candidate advisory lever to run alongside G0.1-advisory (§8 #5):** **loss-scale normalization** — divide
> each task CE by `log(num_classes)` before the static `cw=0.75` (cat `ln 7 ≈ 1.95` vs reg `ln ~9000 ≈ 9.1` ⇒ a
> ~4.7× built-in magnitude gap; `cw=0.75` may be partly undoing it). The one CHEAP, recipe-touching lever aimed
> at the region-sacrifice weakness that is **neither tested nor excluded**, and mechanistically distinct from
> every closed R-gate (a *magnitude* problem → survives the P4 gradient-conflict null). A few lines, no new
> infra. ≥0.3 pp → a v17 candidate like the closed R-gates; null → exclude on the record.

**Throwaway if started early (HOLD until freeze):** seeded per-fold log_T, sequence/fold rebuilds, and **any**
model board run — all windowing- AND recipe-dependent.

## 3 · G0.1 split (removes the p-hacking surface)

- **G0.1-advisory:** current base, AL+FL seed0 — a fast, **non-binding** signal (can run now in Lane B).
- **G0.1-binding:** on whatever base the freeze pins (overlap if adopted), full **{0,1,7,100}**, with the
  **0.3 pp gate pre-registered**. Only the binding run can re-pin recipe v16 → v17. State this in advance so
  there is no temptation to pick the favorable base/seed-subset.
- ⚠ aligned-pairing may interact with stride-1's ~7.5× denser per-sample supervision → the current-base
  result may **not** transfer; the binding run on the frozen base is what counts.

## 4 · The freeze (P2) — SIX axes (one commit)

1. **Recipe** = v16 / champion G, unless **G0.1-binding** promotes → v17. (Confirm `--category-weight 0.75` is
   LIVE under static_weight+onecycle — NOT the historical alternating-step no-op.)
2. **Substrate** = v14, materialized as **ONE hash-manifested canonical artifact per state** (fixed
   machine+seed; CA/TX/GE builds anchored to it; C1/A2/A4 absolutes re-derived against it). ⚠ **GE (Georgia) is
   a first-class M0 BLOCKER, not a presumed sync** — its v14 substrate is ABSENT on the local box (only raw
   `Georgia.parquet` exists); verify-or-build it (substrate + TIGER tracts + region cardinality + `poi_to_region`
   + folds + seeded log_T) on the SAME machine+seed as the hash anchor before the freeze.
3. **Windowing** = the ADOPT/KEEP decision + stride — **validated at FL/small-state first** (§1b). **Window
   length = 9: KEEP (literature-confirmed, §9).** **`MIN_SEQUENCE_LENGTH` = 10 (user-side; NO POI filter)** at
   the frozen base — the field-aligned 10-core *user* side + 9+1-window alignment (every kept user fills ≥1 full
   window); the POI-side 10-core is next-POI-specific (omitted — our targets are category/region). Code:
   `src/data/inputs/core.py:17` 5→10, applied at the **P3 base rebuild** (M0b). ⚠ **Hold MIN at 5 during the
   overlap-validation (Lane 2) to isolate the overlap effect** vs the AL prior — don't confound two base changes.
   Massive-STEPS keeps its native filter (≥2/trail, ≥3 trails/user), disclosed.
4. **Second-dataset windowing + region granularity** = mirror overlap on Massive-STEPS (§1a, user-chosen) + the
   region label: **Istanbul mahalle (520) PRIMARY + H3-9 (2,585) as a sensitivity row; NYC TIGER tracts (1,912)**;
   gap-to-ceiling / lift-over-floor framing mandatory.
5. **Label-space** (now explicit, frozen by VALUE): the 7-root FSQ/Gowalla **category map**; region =
   census/TIGER **tract** on Gowalla + NYC, **mahalle**-primary on Istanbul; **per-state region cardinalities**
   (AL ~1.1k … CA ~8.5k; NYC 1,912; IST 520) — every B1–B5 reg run-spec threads these.
6. **RUN_MATRIX** = the signed cell + baseline-inclusion inventory (pin the E2E set HARD — §6).

Plus the protocol constant: 6 states × {0,1,7,100} × 5 folds (n=20), user-disjoint frozen folds, matched
scorer, geom_simple selector. **NOT pinned:** the numbers (P3 output) and the prose (story locked, numbers
provisional until M4). **Cannot commit** until all three gates close (G0.1-binding, overlap-validated, B1–B5
inclusion), the audit prereqs are met (hash manifest + AL log_T fresh + freshness preflight centralized), **GE
is verified-or-built**, and the §4b decisions are pinned.

### 4b · Freeze-record decisions to PIN (completeness audit, 2026-06-18)

The 4-doc-tree sweep found **zero uncaptured base-changer** — these are "pin-so-it-is-not-silently-inconsistent"
items (all cheap; recommended default in **bold**):
- **T4 Δm metric:** the Δm joint-score table uses reg-**MRR** as primary while the board headline is reg-**Acc@10**
  → pin **Acc@10-primary** (headline-consistent), or compute both + footnote metric-robustness.
- **Cross-state reporting convention:** main-board reg Acc@10 is NOT comparable across states (tracts 1.1k–8.5k) →
  pin the **gap-to-ceiling / lift-over-floor** convention for the main board (consistent with the second dataset),
  or accept absolute-Acc@10 cross-state with a stated caveat.
- **Selection-on-reporting-fold (B7):** no held-out test; selection + reporting share the val fold; §0.1 is
  diagnostic-best → pin **disclosure-only (pair every diagnostic-best number with the deployable geom_simple
  number + state the shared-fold bias)**; one nested-selection/per-state-holdout B7 pass is OPTIONAL.
- **Task-scope pivot (SIGNED):** record the foundational decision — **drop next-POI ranking; report next_category
  (7-class macro-F1) + next_region (Acc@10)** — in the freeze record / PAPER §Methods, with the **affirmative
  task-pairing defense** (the "next-POI MTL with the main task amputated" attack; deployment/sparsity/privacy
  rationale, positioning §2.2; `task_pivot_memo.md` drafts the sentence).
- **Leak re-audit enumerates THREE stride-1 fold paths** (the stride-9 CLEAN verdict does NOT cover them): (a) MTL
  `StratifiedGroupKFold(userid)`, (b) STL-NEXT user-disjointness, (c) **the category-STL plain `StratifiedKFold`
  carve-out** — the one NON-user-grouped fold path (`FOLD_LEAKAGE_AUDIT` line 108), where stride-1 per-(POI,window)
  rows could straddle the cat fold boundary — plus the second-dataset E2 chronological split. Anchor to Luca et al.
  (ML 2023).

## 5 · Post-freeze board (P3) + external validity (Phase V)

- **M0b:** rebuild seeded per-fold log_T + sequences + frozen folds on the **adopted windowing** (FL: consolidate
  the multi-seed log_T from the A40 first).
- **M1 → M2 → M3** (A40, the multi-day bulk): STL cat/reg ceilings → champion G at all 6 states (save per-task-best
  snapshots for the C1 supportive panel) → suite cells (T3/§0.1 first) + **all chosen baselines mirroring the
  adopted windowing**.
- **M4:** single matched-metric board re-score → the paper's source of truth (provisional → final here). **CA/TX
  are the expected-but-unmeasured PARETO cells — the C2 headline (Pareto at all 6 states) cannot be written
  final until these land; if they surprise, the headline is honestly re-scoped.**
- **Phase V (L4, CUDA):** champion G + STL ceilings + Markov-1 on NYC/Istanbul (within-user CV = Gowalla-parity),
  on the frozen substrate **and the §1a windowing decision**.

## 6 · Defer to camera-ready / a follow-up (to cap the open-ended cost)

The full board + all baselines + Phase V is the largest-possible scope. Cap it: **pin the E2E baseline set HARD
at P1b** and treat any post-freeze addition as a camera-ready item, **not** a freeze re-open. Recommended
deferrals (none weaken the core 4 beats):
- **E2/A5 chronological temporal bridge** — beat 4 (external validity) is carried by the within-user CV
  Gowalla-parity comparison; the chrono bridge is a *strengthening* robustness check and is exactly the hardest
  leak-re-audit-under-overlap. **Defer unless cheap.**
- **B4-faithful (CSLSL/CatDM E2E) and B5 DeepMove** — B3 HMT-GRN-style + B5 Flashback-only + the existing
  faithful set already establish the frontier-negative. Recommend the **cheap B4 substrate-column cascade**;
  defer faithful-B4 + DeepMove.
- **F2 scale-progression scatter** (visualizes the dissolved gap → likely DROP); **T2 / §0.8** story-dependent
  (single-v14 board drops T2; §0.8 log_T-KD is NULL on G → do NOT run).
- **EXCLUDE composite / dual-substrate routing from the board** — they forfeit the single-model thesis; if ever
  shown, supportive-panel only, never a freeze-reopening run.

## 7 · Compute realism (honest)

- **Pre-freeze:** CA/TX v14 builds = the metered H100 burst (**measure CA first — TX is ~3× FL and a
  check-in-level HGI build at that scale plausibly exceeds 6 h; route TX → A40 if so**). G0.1-advisory + overlap
  validation + leak re-audit ≈ 1–2 A40-days. Baseline code + hash manifest + reading lane ≈ dev time.
- **Post-freeze (the dominant spend, A40 unmetered):** the board = [champion G + 2 STL ceilings + composite +
  up-to-7 net-new baselines + the existing faithful E2E set] × 6 states × 4 seeds × 5 folds. ⚠ **Under stride-1,
  CA/TX carry ~7.5–8.4× more sequences than non-overlap** — the FL-anchored "hours-to-a-day" estimate is
  optimistic; the full external-baseline suite at n=20 across 6 states under overlap is plausibly an
  **order of magnitude more GPU-hours** and a genuine multi-day-to-week A40 run. **The overlap adoption is the
  cost multiplier.** This is the strongest argument for pinning the baseline set tight (§6).
- **Phase V:** modest (2 cities × 4 seeds × {champion + ceilings + Markov}, small-to-mid corpora).

## 8 · Decisions — the 4 base-forks RESOLVED (user, 2026-06-18) + new audit items

**RESOLVED ✓ (all four):**
1. **Validate overlap FIRST** ✓ — run the FL/small-state multi-seed reproduction + leak re-audit before committing
   the base change.
2. **Second-dataset windowing** ✓ — **mirror overlap on Massive-STEPS** (the complete-picture option).
3. **Baseline set** ✓ — INCLUDE B1 CTLE + B2a/B2b + B3 HMT-GRN-style + B5 Flashback-only + the existing faithful
   set + the **cheap** B4 SC cascade; **defer** faithful-B4 + DeepMove + E2/A5 + F2.
4. **G0.1 binding on the frozen base** ✓ — {0,1,7,100}, 0.3 pp gate pre-registered.

**RESOLVED ✓ (user, 2026-06-18):**
5. **Loss-scale normalization** → **RAN 2026-06-18 (A40, AL+FL seed0) → EXCLUDED (harmful at scale).** Not a
   v17. AL cat +0.61 (small-state rebalance artifact) but **FL reg −37.81 pp** (degenerate head, reached
   epoch 2-6) — normalization divides reg CE by `ln(n_reg)≈8.46` vs cat `ln7≈1.95`, starving the large reg head
   on top of `cw=0.75`; worsens with region cardinality (worst at CA/TX). Recipe stays v16. Verdict:
   [`pre_freeze_gates/LANE1_LOSSSCALE_VERDICT.md`](pre_freeze_gates/LANE1_LOSSSCALE_VERDICT.md).
7. **B7 selection-on-reporting-fold** → **disclosure-only** (pair every diagnostic-best number with the
   deployable geom_simple number + state the shared-fold bias; no separate B7 run).

**6. Windowing / filter — literature-informed (search 2026-06-18; §9):**
- **Window = 9 → KEEP (confirmed).** Typical for the daily-session family + coarse targets; ablations saturate
  early; Massive-STEPS has no window standard. Locked into axis 3.
- **`MIN_SEQUENCE_LENGTH` → RESOLVED ✓ (user, option A): raise the user-side floor 5→10** (`core.py:17`),
  **no POI filter**. Rationale: matches the Gowalla **10-core** field mode on the user side (comparable to
  GETNext/STAN/SGRec), aligns with the 9+1 window (every kept user fills ≥1 full window → removes all-padding
  users; window/sample count drops far less than the user count), and the POI-side 10-core is next-POI-specific
  (rare-POI *targets*) so it is correctly omitted for our category/region targets. Applied at the **P3 rebuild**;
  **held at 5 during the Lane-2 overlap-validation** to isolate the overlap effect. **Second dataset keeps
  Massive-STEPS' native filter (≥2/trail, ≥3 trails/user), disclosed** — not force-10-cored (gap-to-ceiling
  framing normalizes the cold-start population).

None of these blocks the §2 NOW-lanes; they gate the freeze. **GE (Georgia) is a hard M0 BLOCKER** (axis 2) —
not a decision, a build.

## 9 · Windowing / filter literature (search 2026-06-18)

**Window length.** Field is bimodal: daily-session 2–10 (DeepMove, LSTPM, GETNext avg ~7–8) · fixed-RNN ≈20
(Flashback, SGRec, PLSPL) · long attention caps =100 (STAN, GeoSAN, padding-dominated). **Window=9 is
typical/short-but-normal**; ablations show next-POI accuracy *saturates early* and very long windows add noise;
coarse targets need less context → 9 is sufficient/generous for next-category/next-region. **Massive-STEPS**
(Wongso, Xue, Salim; arXiv:2505.11239, ACM 2026): no window standard — variable-length trails grouped by an
**8 h inter-check-in gap**, mostly 2–10 check-ins; baselines inherit LibCity defaults.
**Activity filter.** Mode = **10-core** (user ≥10 AND POI ≥10: GETNext, SGRec, LSTPM, GeoSAN, PLSPL); stricter
outliers Flashback ≥100, HMT-GRN 20–50; Massive-STEPS lenient (≥2/trail, ≥3 trails/user). **Our 5 is lenient +
one-sided.** Sources: Flashback (IJCAI'20, code `setting.py` `sequence_length=20`/`min_checkins=101`),
