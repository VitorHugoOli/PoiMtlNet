# JOINT_BEST_RESULTS — the deployable single-checkpoint numbers for Table 3

> **Convention discipline (read once).** Every number here is one of two conventions, always named:
> **diag-best** = per-task diagnostic-best (cat at its F1-best epoch, reg at its Acc@10-best epoch — *two*
> epochs/fold; the currently-reported Table 3). **joint-best (deploy)** = the single saved checkpoint, both
> heads read at the `geom_simple = sqrt(cat_macroF1 · reg_top10_acc_indist)`-selected epoch (`min_best_epoch=0`).
> Selection logic SSOT: `src/tracking/scoring.py`; scorer `scripts/closing_data/score_joint_best.py`.
> All cells are **v17 on `check2hgi_dk_ovl`, fp32** — the same runs as Table 3, re-read at one epoch instead of two.

## Headline

**The deployable single checkpoint reproduces the reported Table 3 to within ≤ 0.06 pp (category) and ≤ 0.11 pp
(region) on every one of the six datasets — the largest deviations are 0.051 pp (category) and 0.107 pp
(region), both at AZ. No verdict changes.** Category still beats the dedicated ceiling
everywhere (+5.3 … +9.4); region still beats at Istanbul/FL/TX/CA and stays a within-2-pp match at AL/AZ. The
diag-best cells are, in practice, exactly what one served model delivers — the diag/joint distinction is
numerically negligible for these well-converged v17 runs (every joint epoch lands late, 34–50 of 50).

## The corrected table (diag-best vs joint-best, side by side)

Category = macro-F1, region = Acc@10 (FULL = top10_acc_indist·(1−ood_frac)). "Dedicated" = the n=20 best-vs-best
single-task ceiling (`CEILINGS_N20_FINAL.md`, unchanged). n=20 = 4 seeds {0,1,7,100}×5f (± cross-seed sd);
CA/TX = seed-0 ×5f provisional (± fold sd).

## Δ vs the dedicated ceiling — does the verdict change?

| Dataset | Δcat diag | Δcat **deploy** | verdict | Δreg diag | Δreg **deploy** | verdict |
|---|---:|---:|---|---:|---:|---|
| Istanbul | +8.59 | **+8.58** | beats | +0.28 | **+0.19** | beats (thinner) |
| AL | +7.72 | **+7.69** | beats | −0.31 | **−0.41** | matches (≪2 pp) |
| AZ | +9.40 † | **+9.35** | beats | +0.10 | **−0.00** | matches |
| FL | +5.34 | **+5.33** | beats | +0.72 | **+0.71** | beats |
| TX | +7.44 | **+7.44** | beats | +2.12 | **+2.12** | beats |
| CA | +6.44 | **+6.44** | beats | +2.20 | **+2.20** | beats |

† AZ diag Δcat: **+9.40** is the paper/board value (from the rounded 65.83 MTL cell, `CEILINGS_N20_FINAL.md`);
the full-precision Δ from these cells (65.835 − 56.43) is **+9.41**, which is what `score_all.py` / `j1_results.json`
print. Same 0.01-pp rounding wobble as the paper's own prose. The AZ cat ceiling itself carries a pending 2-seed
top-up that could raise it to ~57.0 (Δcat → ~+8.8) — a live paper caveat, unrelated to joint-best.

**Every Table-3 verdict is preserved under the deployable convention:**
- **Category — beats at all six** (+5.33 … +9.35). The joint checkpoint costs ≤ 0.051 pp of category vs diag-best.
- **Region — beats at Istanbul / FL / TX / CA; matches (TOST, ±2 pp) at AL / AZ.** Direction unchanged everywhere.

Two cells to keep honest (both still on the correct side of their claim):
1. **Istanbul region** thins from +0.28 to **+0.19** (still a positive point estimate; still "beats"). This is
   the single most margin-sensitive cell. The independent audit went to the per-fold pairs: the joint-best MTL reg
   still beats the STL ceiling in **20/20 folds** (min +0.074, mean +0.194) — so a formal Wilcoxon/90%-CI would
   still reject. The camera-ready superiority stat should be re-run on the joint-best per-fold pairs (task **T7**);
   the *direction* is preserved and per-fold-robust.
2. **AZ region** moves +0.10 → **−0.00** — but AZ was always a *match*, never a beat (the paper never bolds it),
   so the claim is unchanged. **AL region** moves −0.31 → **−0.41**: the J1 runbook flagged AL as the tail risk
   (a legacy smoke run once saw −1.16); the actual v17 joint-best drop is **−0.11 pp**, landing at −0.41 —
   **nowhere near the −2 pp non-inferiority bound.** The tail risk did not materialize.

## Audit — three parity gates (all pass)

| Gate | What it proves | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **A · diag-best parity** | scorer's diag-best re-derivation == each rundir's committed `a40_matched_score.json` | **18/18 exact** |
| **B · joint-epoch fidelity** | scorer's `e*` == training's `folds/foldN_info.json → primary_checkpoint.epoch` (+1 for 1-based-CSV vs 0-based-loop) | **90/90 folds** |
| **C · paper parity** | aggregated diag-best cell == paper `tbl3_results.tex` | **6/6 exact to 2 dp** |

Gate B was verified down to the value: AL s0 fold-1 training checkpoint (epoch 35, 0-based; cat_f1 0.6455,
reg_top10_indist 0.7241, joint_score 0.6837) == CSV epoch 36 (1-based; identical cat_f1 / indist / geom
0.683666) == sidecar `selector_per_fold[0]`. The joint-best re-score recovers the *exact* checkpoint the training
gate saved — no retraining, no GPU. No fold collapsed (every joint epoch 34–50; no reg best-epoch ≤ 5).

Independent adversarial audit (from-scratch re-derivation, AL tail-risk, Istanbul/FL sensitivity, completeness):
see [`AUDIT.md`](AUDIT.md).

## Decision memo

- **The gap is closed and it is benign.** The served single checkpoint delivers the reported Table 3 within
  ≤ 0.11 pp; the response-letter can now state this as fact instead of "can be provided on request."
- **Recommended camera-ready action** (author's call): either (a) keep Table 3 as diag-best and add one sentence
  in §6.2 — "the single served checkpoint reproduces these cells within 0.1 pp (deployable joint-best,
  `geom_simple` selector)"; or (b) add a joint-best row/column. Numbers for both are here.
- **What must travel with these numbers:** always name the convention; the CA/TX cells are seed-0 provisional
  (T6, blocked on A1 n=20); the Istanbul region superiority stat wants a joint-best re-run (T7); AL/AZ region are
  *matches*, never beats.
