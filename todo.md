1. Finish to ensure that the input for tasks is beedn creating correct ☑️
   1. Optmize the creating, especialily for next checking embeddings
   2. Test the new code agains the olds results and see the results are the same
3. Validate the space2vec ☑️
4. Validate the time2vec embeddings ☑️
5. On the train pipe pass the len of the embeddings
6. Improve the traning of next poi
