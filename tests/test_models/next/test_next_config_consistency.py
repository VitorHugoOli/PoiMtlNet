Test suite for Next-POI configuration consistency.

Tests that default hyperparameters are consistent, reasonable, and match
between ExperimentConfig and model implementations.

These constants were originally in CfgNextModel/CfgNextHyperparams/CfgNextTraining
(deprecated configs removed in cleanup). The tests validate architectural
constraints that must hold regardless of config source.
