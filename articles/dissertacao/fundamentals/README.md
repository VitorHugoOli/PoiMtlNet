# Fundamentals (Chapter 2) — consolidated reference base and section maps

> **⏸ FROZEN 2026-07-24 — IMPORTED into `src/`.** The five section files + the model-lineage
> table drafted here were inlined into the assembled v1 at `../src/chapters/2_fundamentals.tex`
> (Phase 3). **`src/` is now the single working copy** (single-source rule, CLAUDE.md §1). Do NOT

This folder consolidates the grounded, fail-closed literature review for Ch. 2. It is organized by the chapter's
own sections. Everything here is verification output and planning material; **no chapter prose is drafted yet**
(the author approves before any section is written).

## Reading order
1. **GAP_STATUS.md** — what was closed and what still needs the author.
2. The four **2.x_citations.md** — the works to cite per section, in argument order, each with the sentence it supports.
3. **2.4_metrics_addendum.md** — the project's real metrics (Δm etc.) with defensive definitions.
4. **2.5_relevance_plan.md** + **model_lineage_table.md** — the synthesis section and the lineage table.
5. **_bib/** and **_verification/** — the bibliography and the audit trail.

## Ground rules honored
- Fail-closed citation protocol (identifier + opened record + located claim, else [VERIFY]).
- Canonical task vocabulary kept distinct: next place / next category / next region / category classification.
- Fundamentals ≠ frontier: frontier material routed to related-work / future-work.
- Repo codenames translated to canonical prose; no numbers invented (repo counts quoted from docs/context).
