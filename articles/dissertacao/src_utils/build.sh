# This lived in /tmp for one whole working session and was swept mid-session, which silently turned
# a "rebuild and check" step into "check a stale PDF". It belongs in the repository.
#
# VERIFICATION RULES, each learned by shipping the corresponding defect:
#   - LaTeX WRAPS warnings at 79 columns, so the log MUST be flattened before matching. A
#     line-anchored grep reported "0 undefined citations" while four rendered as (??) in both PDFs.
#   - The .blg must be read separately: a BibTeX error (e.g. a bare at-sign inside a % comment in
#     references.bib) never reaches the .log.
#   - "Text page N contains only floats" is NOT emitted for every floats-only page, so those are
#     measured from the PDF text layer instead.
#   - Report ONLY the variants this invocation actually built; a stale build/<stem>.log was
#     otherwise presented as a fresh measurement.
#   - FAIL LOUDLY if a build produced no PDF. A silent build failure is how a stale PDF gets
#     audited in place of the real one.
#
# The TeX font map must come from the user tree; without TEXMFVAR/TEXMFCONFIG set, pdflatex dies
# with "Font ntx-Regular-tlf-ot1r ... not found" (or t1xtt, depending on which face it reaches
# first). That is NOT a missing font: the .tfm and .pfb are both in $TEXMFHOME. It is the font
# MAP, which newtx writes into the usermode updmap output. The defaults below point at the
# PERSISTENT tree under $TEXMFHOME rather than /tmp: a swept /tmp used to lose the map and
# trigger a full updmap-user rebuild, and on this machine
# `kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFVAR` reports an unreadable path, so it cannot be probed either.
# Same values as src_utils/texenv.sh, which is what a human should source before `make`.
