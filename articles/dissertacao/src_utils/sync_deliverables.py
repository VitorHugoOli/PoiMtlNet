"""Copy dissertation deliverables into the agent workspace, verify each by checksum, and FAIL loudly.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Twice in this project a deliverable was saved as an artifact from a STALE workspace copy, because the
`cp` that was supposed to refresh it ran with a different working directory than expected (a `cd` in
the same shell cell had moved it), so the copy landed somewhere else and the save silently promoted
the previous file. The artifact store then deduplicated it to the earlier version, which is why the
save's own echo looked normal: same size, same checksum, no error.

The second occurrence shipped a register artifact WITHOUT the section the accompanying message
promised. The failure is invisible at save time, so it has to be caught before the save.

WHAT THIS DOES
--------------
Copies each named file from the repository to the workspace using ABSOLUTE paths on both sides (never
relative, never dependent on cwd), then re-reads both and compares sha256. Any mismatch is a hard
error. Optionally asserts that a required string is present in the copied file, which is the check
that would have caught the BLOCO 0f case.

Usage:
    python3 src_utils/sync_deliverables.py --workspace /path/to/workspace
    python3 src_utils/sync_deliverables.py --workspace ... --require PENDENCIAS.md='BLOCO 0f'
