"""Check that a before/after word-count claim in the registers reconciles with its own stated numbers.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
On 2026-07-27 a register entry claimed "real compression was ~13 words of gloss, not the 36 I
reported: the other ~30 were clauses deleted by accident". Its own three stages were printed in the
same session:

    before compression    Resumo 565   Abstract 485
    after (clauses gone)         529            452
    clauses restored             542            466

which give compression 23 / 19 and deletion 13 / 14. The write-up had the two SWAPPED, and "~30"
reconciles with no grouping (the deletion across both languages sums to 27). An audit caught it; the
error was in the prose about the measurement, not the measurement.

That is the third arithmetic error this project has made in a WRITE-UP of correct work. The pattern
is always the same: a difference is described in words rather than recomputed from the endpoints.

WHAT THIS CHECKS
----------------
Wherever a register file states a triple of word counts in a markdown table together with a claimed
split, this recomputes the split from the endpoints and fails when the prose disagrees. It is
deliberately narrow: it verifies the Resumo/Abstract compression claim, the one that has already gone
wrong, rather than trying to parse arbitrary arithmetic out of prose.

Usage:  python3 src_utils/check_wordcount_claims.py
Exit 1 on a disagreement.
