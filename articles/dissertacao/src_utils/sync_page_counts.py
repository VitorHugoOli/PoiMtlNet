"""Sync the recorded page counts in the governance files to the measured build.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The page counts in CLAUDE.md, PLAN.md, PENDENCIAS.md and codex_reviewer.md are PRESENT-TENSE claims
about what is on disk, and they have now drifted three times (87/83 -> 89/84 -> 103/98 -> 104/99).
Each drift was found by review, never by the author of the edit, because the cell that changes the
document is never the cell that updates the record.

The page-drift note in codex_reviewer.md is load-bearing: it tells a reader that every file:line in
that review has moved, and by roughly how much. A wrong count there silently misleads.

Run after any build that changes the page count:
    python3 src_utils/sync_page_counts.py            # report only
    python3 src_utils/sync_page_counts.py --write    # apply

Exits 1 when a recorded count disagrees with the build, so it can gate a commit.

# THE THIRD FIELD IS THE INTERNAL KEY, NOT DOC TEXT. It was "final" until 2026-07-29 and is now

# REGEXES are deliberately NOT renamed with it: they match what the author-facing documents
# actually say, and those documents still say `make final` / `main_final.pdf`. Renaming a
# pattern to match a document that has not changed is how this tool went silent on 2026-07-28 --
# it printed nothing and exited 0 while four page-count claims went unchecked. If a document is
# later reworded to `academico`, change its pattern HERE in the same commit and confirm this
# script still reports it (an UNMATCHED line is the loud failure; there is no silent skip).

    # PENDENCIAS was rewritten as a three-part tracker on 2026-07-28 and its build state became a
    # table row per target, not a "X/Y" pair in prose. The old patterns SKIPped silently after that,
    # which is the same failure this whole tool exists to prevent: a page-count claim nobody checks.
    #
    # RETIRED 2026-07-29 (trackers track), and retired rather than repointed on purpose. That §1
    # table lived inside the "Fechado nesta rodada" section, which moved to
    # _archive/PENDENCIAS_RESOLVIDOS.md when the tracker was split -- so these three patterns went
    # UNMATCHED, i.e. three guards reporting that the claim they protected was no longer checked.
    # (Confirmed in both directions: all three match ba5dd5b3^:PENDENCIAS.md and none matches the
    # split file.) They are NOT repointed at the archive, because an archived record is a historical
    # snapshot and must NOT be rewritten when the build moves -- guarding it would make this tool
    # edit history. And they are NOT repointed at the live tracker's new build-state section,
    # because that section deliberately carries NO per-target page number today: the tree was being
    # rebuilt by a concurrent track and the honest claim was "not confirmed, remeasure when it
    # settles". A guard over a number that is not asserted has nothing to check.
    #
    # WHEN THE TRACKER CARRIES PAGE COUNTS AGAIN, restore three rows here in the same commit that
    # adds them, or this comment becomes the next silent gap.
    #
    # RESTORED 2026-07-30, in the commit that reintroduced the numbers. PENDENCIAS §4 item 5 is the
    # author's own "run these before you trust anything" list, and it had drifted twice over: it told
    # him to run `make final` (renamed to `academico` on 2026-07-29) and promised 108/105/109 against
    # a tree building 101/98/102. I corrected it by hand -- and MY CORRECTION WAS STALE WITHIN THE
    # HOUR, because a concurrent track added a page to §2.3 between my measurement and the next
    # build. That is the argument for the guard rather than for more careful typing: this is the one
    # page-count claim the author is most likely to act on, and it was the only one no tool watched.
    # The pattern matches the three-target form "**102/99/103** paginas" as a unit, so all three
    # targets are checked, and a fourth number in that slot cannot pass silently.
    # REMOVED 2026-07-30. These three watched the "**102/99/103** paginas" claim in PENDENCIAS §4, and
    # §4 was retired the same day (VERIFY_LIST closed, so the audit-priority list it pointed at had no
    # reason to exist). The claim they guarded is GONE, not stale: there is no page-count assertion left
    # in PENDENCIAS.md to keep in sync. Verified before removing, and stated precisely because a loose
    # count would be wrong: `grep -c "\*\*[0-9]+/[0-9]+/[0-9]+\*\* paginas"` returns 0, i.e. no claim in
    # the three-target form these rows parsed. The bare word "paginas" still appears 11 times, all of
    # them prose about a past measurement ("medido contra o build de 101 paginas") or a page RANGE in a
    # citation, none of them a present-tense assertion of this tree's page count. That distinction is
    # the whole point of the rows: they guard claims a build can falsify, not mentions of the word.
    # Left as a comment rather than deleted so the next agent does not re-add a row for a claim the file
    # no longer makes. The gate's UNMATCHED branch caught this immediately, which is what it is for: a
    # pattern that stops matching is a claim that has become unchecked, and that is a defect either way.
