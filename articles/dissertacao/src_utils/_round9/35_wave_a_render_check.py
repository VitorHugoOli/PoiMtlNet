# REPOINTED 2026-08-02, when the author's revised tree (src_clean) was merged into src.
# All six of these went ABSENT after the merge. Each was checked in the RENDER before being
# repointed, and in every case the advisor's request is still satisfied -- the author expressed
# it in his own words rather than the exact string this file pinned. Examples: FAB-12 asked for
# the generic plural, and his revision reads "check-in records associating a user, a point of
# interest (POI), and a time"; FAB-16 asked that the next-place task be marked as out of scope,
# and his reads "predicts the exact next place, so none of them is a direct baseline for the
# targets studied in this dissertation". The OLD-string assertions are kept: they still prove the
# superseded wording has not come back.

"""Wave A, verified in the RENDERED PDF -- both directions, every item, as a runnable check.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Three times in round 9 a summary sentence claimed a measurement that had not
been taken (ten stale anchors that were nine; eight applied items that were seven; seven
both-directions render checks that were three). The first two were caught by a reviewer, the third
was caught in the paragraph written to close out the second. Prose that says "verified in both
directions" is a claim; this file is the evidence, and it re-runs in two seconds.

WHAT IT ASSERTS. For each Wave A edit: the NEW wording is present in build/main.pdf's text layer AND
the SUPERSEDED wording is absent. Sixteen assertions over seven items -- FAB-11 is checked in both
languages, because the Resumo and the Abstract must move together or they contradict.

FAB-01 IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE. It was already satisfied before this round: nothing was edited, so
there is no superseded wording that could be absent and the both-directions form does not apply to
it. Its presence-only check is the last row, labelled as such. Counting it among the applied edits is
the exact defect this file guards.

Usage:  python3 35_wave_a_render_check.py [path/to/main.pdf]      rc 0 = every assertion holds
