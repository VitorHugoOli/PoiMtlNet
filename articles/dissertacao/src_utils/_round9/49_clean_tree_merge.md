# 49 · Merging the author's revised tree into `src`

**What this is.** On 2026-08-02 the author delivered `src_clean`, a tree he had read and edited
himself. He asked for three things: bring it into `src`, audit whether any of the agent's recent
changes were lost in it, and decide which comments should stay. This records what was measured.

## The tree he delivered had no comment layer

| | `src` before | `src_clean` | `src` after the merge |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| comment lines | 4,114 | 55 | 4,234 |
| comment blocks | 275 | ~2 | 275 |
| `[NEEDS SIGN-OFF]` markers | 54 | 0 | 54 |

His prose is byte-for-byte his in all 54 shared files. The comment layer was re-anchored onto it by
aligning the two trees' prose with a sequence matcher and reattaching each block to the prose line it
preceded. **228 of 275 blocks re-anchored exactly.** The other 47 annotate sentences he rewrote or
cut; they are kept, marked `[ORPHANED 2026-08-02]`, listed below.

This mattered beyond history: `check_comment_hygiene`, `check_trapped_prose` and `check_audit_claims`
read the comment layer, and the provenance pointers into `PENDENCIAS_RESOLVIDOS` live in it.

## What he was missing, and what he had already fixed better

Fifteen changes had landed in `src` after he forked. **Fourteen were absent from his tree.** None
collided with his edits, verified by checking each passage against the fork baseline.

| | outcome |
|---|---|
| reapplied to his prose | R15-01, R15-01b, R15-02, R15-02b, R15-04, R15-04b, R15-06, R15-06b, R15-08, B5-2 |
| **obsolete: his rewrite dissolved the defect** | R15-03b, B5-1, R15-07, R15-07b |
| already present in his tree | R15-03 |

The four obsolete ones were confirmed by checking the *defect*, not the fix: the omitted pronouns and
the 24-word preposed protocol clause are absent from his text because he rewrote those sentences.

## The Abstract and Resumo, on his instruction

His revision dropped the equivalence-test wording, the numbers, and the expansion of MTL. He ruled:
restore the TOST language and the expansion, restore the numbers **without** "joint-best selection"
(an unexplained term), and add the external-baseline comparison. That last claim was verified at
source before being written: Chapter 5 states the joint model "is also above every external baseline
reported, on both tasks, across all six datasets", naming HMT-GRN, STAN, a ReHDM reference, POI-RGNN
and the Markov floor.

## Gate failures after the merge: seven stale patterns, one real move, one real defect

Eleven checks failed. **Each was traced to its cause rather than repointed to make it pass.**

| check | cause | action |
|---|---|---|
| `A11-frame`, `A11-frame2` | he writes the adjective, probe demanded the noun | repointed |
| `A23-EX9`, `R9-pareto` ×3, `R9-conflict` | concepts survive in his wording | repointed |
| `NUM-4` | **the HGI sweep MOVED to his new `apx_g_hgi_tuning.tex`** (renders p. 106) | repointed to that file |
| six `FAB-*` render assertions | advisor's requests satisfied in his words, not his strings | repointed, verified in the PDF first |
| `VERIFY_LIST` repair clause | moved to `apx_a_contributions.tex` | repointed |
| `VERIFY_LIST` page number | his revision added a page; invariant still holds | expectation updated |
| `check_trapped_prose`, `check_torn_sentences` | **defects the merge itself introduced** | fixed, below |

`NUM-4` is the one that was not a wording change. Repointing it by pattern-fiddling would have
recorded a lost measurement as a rewrite.

## Two defects the merge introduced, and one instrument gap

Five orphan-marker blocks landed *between* the two halves of a sentence, one of them swallowing a
line of prose from the render. All five relocated below their sentence; swept for the shape and none
remain.

`check_torn_sentences` fired on the author's own line wrap after "non-U.S.", which is not a sentence
end. Guarded by matching the abbreviation rather than exempting the file, and validated in both
directions with a fixture whose opening word is not in `LEGIT_OPENER` (the first fixture used "of",
which the checker legitimately allows, so its silence proved nothing).

## One real inconsistency, resolved on his ruling

The merged document carried both spellings of the central term: **"multitask learning" 20× and
"multi-task learning" 18×**. `GLOSSARY.md:130` registers "multitask learning", so his spelling is
canonical. Only **three** of the hyphenated instances are prose; the other 36 are cited titles in
`references.bib` and must not be altered. The three were changed; the titles were not.

## The `VERIFY_LIST` region check, rewritten to check the claim

Its original grep pinned the literal "four of six". The author reworded that claim twice during this
session, and each rewording made the probe report a defect that was not there. It now measures what
the finding is about: whether a region-win claim ever appears without its non-inferiority qualifier.
The caveat window extends past the claim's own full stop, because Chapter 6 correctly puts it in the
next sentence. Validated by removing a caveat: rc=1, then rc=0 restored.

## The 47 orphaned comment blocks, for the author

Each annotates a sentence that is no longer in the text. None was deleted.
