# 37_reviewer_gate_round9.md — the four G2/G3 fact gates, run against build `03b53d16`

Round 9, 2026-07-30. Four fresh-eyes personas in the documented gate-day order (04 concordance, 05
citations, 06 numbers, 07 claims/honesty), each given a 25-minute wall-clock checkpoint and told to
report unfinished work as unfinished. All four came back inside it, and **all four reported unfinished
scope**, which is what a bounded pass is supposed to look like.

**Build under review:** commit `03b53d16`; `main.pdf` 102 pp, `main_academico.pdf` 99 pp,
`main_ppgc.pdf` 103 pp, `main_extra.pdf` 20 pp. `make check` rc=0, `make selftest` rc=0, read directly.

## The three blockers, each re-verified by me in the source before being written down

A persona's self-report is not evidence (`AGENT_GUARDRAILS` L6). Every blocker below was opened and
confirmed independently; the check is named so the author can repeat it.

### B-1 · Appendix F claims hard sharing "costs nothing", and calls the wrong topology hard sharing
- **Where:** `chapters/apx_f_cosine.tex`:290, rendering at `main.pdf` p. 101.
- **Verbatim:** "That is why hard sharing costs nothing in this architecture, and why
  Chapter~\ref{ch:mobiwac} finds no balancer improving on a fixed loss weighting".
- **Confirmed, two independent defects in one clause.** First, the cost claim is unbounded and the
  document refutes it: `5_mobiwac/06_results.tex`:145-146 records the region gain running "from
  $-0.41$ at the smallest count to $+2.20$ at the largest", i.e. a **negative** cell. Second, the
  architecture it names is not hard sharing on this document's own definition:
  `5_mobiwac/01_introduction.tex` describes "a shared trunk (a cross-attention stack where the two
  tasks exchange semantic context) and a private spatial path for the region task".
- **Author's call.** The licensed statement is about the mechanism, not the cost, and the chapter
  already has one ("sharing stopped hurting").

### B-2 · The consolidated answer uses bare "everywhere" and collapses the region partition
- **Where:** `chapters/6_conclusion.tex`:106, rendering at `main.pdf` p. 79.
- **Verbatim:** "outperforms the dedicated models on the category task everywhere and outperforms or
  matches them on the region task."
- **Confirmed against the law, which is unusually explicit here.** `WRITING_LAW.md`:83 reads: the
  region-count scaling claim is scoped to the five U.S. states; **bare "everywhere" never**. Line 75
  separately bans "outperforms region everywhere". And "outperforms or matches" discards the
  four-of-six / TOST partition that the protected wording requires and that the same chapter states
  correctly on the preceding page.
- **Author's call.** This is the single most-quoted sentence in the dissertation.

### B-3 · Two size-span factors derived in prose, with no ledger and no script
- **Where:** `chapters/apx_f_cosine.tex`:317-319, rendering at `main.pdf` p. 101.
- **Verbatim:** "this axis spans a factor of thirty-six in volume and one of sixteen in the size of
  the region label set".
- **Confirmed, and the numbers are RIGHT:** 4,089,892 / 113,846 = 35.92 and 8,501 / 520 = 16.35, and
  the four endpoints are themselves clean in `datasets.tex`. The finding is not an arithmetic error.
  It is that both factors are **computed in prose**, which `AGENT_GUARDRAILS` N2/N3 forbid — quote,
  never compute — so nothing regenerates or re-checks them when a dataset changes.
- **Cheapest fix:** state the four endpoint counts, which are already traceable, and drop the ratios;
  or add them to the appendix's ledger with the command that produces them.

## What the gates verified as INTACT, which matters as much as the findings

The honesty gate's inventory is the load-bearing one: **zero** BRACIS mentions in any of the four
volumes; **zero** instances of "beats", "wins", or a Pareto-dominance claim; the Arizona result never
upgraded from a match to a gain ("a match, not a gain", p. 73); the Alabama deficit stated plainly
rather than buried; MobiWac described as "submitted, under review" at **all five** status sites with
no "accepted" anywhere; the three time-capsule prefaces present; the Pareto non-claim sentence
present; the cosine result traveling with its full four-state scope; and the Resumo/Abstract pair
claim-for-claim parallel across both languages. The concordance gate found the cross-reference graph
clean (113 labels, 269 references, no duplicates, no dangling, no `??` in the rendered PDF) and found
the protected region wording, the 5.3-9.4 category range, and the n=20 arithmetic concordant at every
site it checked. The citation gate resolved 26 entries against Crossref/arXiv/DataCite/OpenAlex and
found **no fabricated or unresolvable reference**, no duplicate keys for one work, and a rendered
reference list numbered 1-99 with no gaps.

## A finding that corrected ME, not the document

The citation gate went looking for the two GNN references Germano asked for and reported that neither
`bruna2014spectral` nor `scarselli2009gnn` exists in `references.bib` or is cited anywhere. **That is
correct and it is the intended state**: both were verified this session but GER-01 is in Wave B,
behind another agent's open edit of Chapter 2, so nothing was inserted. Worth recording because a
reader of my source ledger could mistake "verified" for "in the document".

More usefully, the same gate found that the repository had **already verified `wang2025hamtl`** —
`references.bib`:1148-1152 carries a provenance block recording a read of the Springer article page on
2026-07-06 and its finding that HAMTL's location target is venue-level. I had written that paper up as
content-unknown because *this session* could not open it. The correction is in
`36_source_ledger.md` and in FAB-28's block: the item stays blocked, but the question the author
actually cares about is probably already answered, on the repo's own record.

## Unfinished, reported by the gates themselves

None of the four covered its whole scope, and each said so. The largest gaps, in the order I would
close them:

1. **Chapters 3 and 4 were not audited for numbers at all** (roughly 40 percent of the volume's
   numeral tokens). The numbers gate routed them to the published papers' tables and did not open
   them.
2. **Chapter 2 §2.3's new Pareto material was not citation-audited.** The attributions at
   `2_fundamentals.tex`:431-448 (`sener2018mgda`, `nash`, `liu2021cagrad`, `senushkin2023aligned`,
   `yu2020pcgrad`) are the highest-value target for the next pass — new prose, five attributions, and
   the honesty gate already flagged one clause there as possibly the writer's gloss rather than the
   source's claim.
3. **73 of 99 bibliography entries unchecked at attribute level**; claim-support sampling reached 4
   sites against the 20 percent floor R3 asks for.
4. **Only `main.pdf` was read by three of the four gates.** The other three volumes were swept, not
   read.

## The six style/readability personas did not run

Gate-day order puts 03 style, 01 cold reader, 15 readability, 16 AI credibility, 18 visual and 19
LaTeX source after the fact gates. They are **not run** in this round. Two of the three blockers are
prose-level claims the author must settle first, and running a style pass over sentences that are
about to change would produce a report stale on arrival — which is the defect this round was told to
avoid.
