"""mkformat.py -- precompile this document's preamble into a pdflatex format dump.

WHY. The preamble -- abntex2 + memoir + newtxmath + hyperref + abntex2cite -- dominates every
pdflatex pass, and a build runs three of them. MEASURED IN THIS SESSION, cold, per full
three-pass build: 122.7 s plain against 15.4 s with the dump loaded (defense; the other two
targets are in the table). The dump itself cost 33.7 s to build.

Do NOT quote a per-pass split from this docstring. The "~32 s per pass, ~28 s of it preamble,
~87%" figures were inherited from the round brief, not measured here, and this file previously
presented them as its own measurement. What this session measured is the whole-build
before/after above; the per-pass decomposition is consistent with it but unverified here.
Every number, with the command that produced it and a contention caveat that matters (the same
build spanned 105-128 s across four runs): src_utils/_round7/20_build_speed.md §3.

WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES. It derives THREE files into build/fmt/ and never asks a human to keep
anything in sync:

  build/fmt/_pre.tex      main.tex's switch block + 0_main.tex's PREAMBLE region + \\endofdump
  build/fmt/_body.tex     0_main.tex's BODY region, from \\begin{document} to \\end{document}
  build/fmt/_run_<t>.tex  three lines per target: set the two switches, \\input the body

  build/fmt/mainpre.fmt   the dump itself
  build/fmt/fmt.key       the staleness key of the sources the dump was built from

THE SPLIT IS MECHANICAL, WHICH IS THE POINT. A hand-made split is how the first attempt at
this left a stray \\begin{document} in the body driver: the driver then re-read the whole of
0_main.tex, \\documentclass ran a second time, and the pass logged
"! LaTeX Error: Can be used only in preamble." while STILL emitting a PDF -- failure mode
science/AGENT_HANDOFF.md §2.3b exactly (a PDF existing is not evidence the source is
correct). Here the boundary is found by locating \\begin{document} in 0_main.tex, and the two
halves are complementary byte ranges of one file, so neither can contain the other's
commands. verify_format.py asserts `grep -c '^! '` is zero on the accelerated log rather
than trusting that a PDF appeared.

THE STALENESS GUARD IS THE OTHER HALF. A format dump is silently wrong when the preamble
moves under it: the build succeeds and the PDF is stale, which is the worst failure shape
this repository has (§2.3b again, and §2.4b). The key below covers, in order:

  1. the byte content of main.tex's switch region  (\\newif ... \\finalbuildfirstpage)
  2. the byte content of 0_main.tex's preamble region (everything before \\begin{document})
  3. the byte offset of that \\begin{document}      (so a moving boundary moves the key)
  4. the full byte content of abntex2-UFV.sty      (a local class-level style file)
  5. this script's own byte content                (a changed generator invalidates the dump)
  6. pdflatex's version banner
  7. every FILE THE DUMP ITSELF LOADED: path, size and mtime, read out of mainpre.log

Item 7 is what makes the guard closed rather than merely likely: the first six cover this
repository, and item 7 covers the ~90 class, package and font-map files in the TeX trees
that the preamble pulls in. Touch any of them and the key moves. `make fast` rebuilds the
dump when the key moves, so a stale-format build cannot be requested.

Deliberately NOT in the key: 0_main.tex's body region, chapters/, tables/, figures/ and
references.bib. Those are read at run time on every pass, so a prose edit must NOT cost a
28 s re-dump -- that would defeat the accelerator on the one edit the author makes most.

USAGE (from src/, with src_utils/texenv.sh sourced):
    python3 ../src_utils/mkformat.py --emit         # write the derived .tex files only
    python3 ../src_utils/mkformat.py --status       # exit 0 fresh, 1 stale/absent, and say why
    python3 ../src_utils/mkformat.py --build        # emit, then dump the format if stale
    python3 ../src_utils/mkformat.py --build --force
Run --selftest to exercise the split and the key on synthetic trees (both directions).

    THIS FUNCTION IS THE WHOLE SAFETY MARGIN OF THE SPLIT, and it exists because the
    comment-blind version was actively dangerous rather than merely wrong. main.tex's header
    quotes the switch pattern inside a provenance comment:

        %       pdflatex "\\newif\\ifdefensebuild\\defensebuildfalse\\input{main.tex}"

    A plain str.find() for the switch anchor lands THERE, above the real declaration, and
    slicing from the match offset drops the leading `%` -- so that quoted command becomes LIVE
    code in the dump and recursively \\input{main.tex} inside the format. 0_main.tex has the same
    trap for \\begin{document} ("... would be too late").

    MEASURED on this tree, and stated carefully because the first version of this comment gave
    two figures that were both wrong. The region the fixed extractor returns is 2,293 bytes, of
    which 229 bytes in 5 lines are LIVE code and the rest is the interleaved provenance commentary
    that must be carried along (it sits between the \\newif blocks). A comment-blind find() from
    the first match to the last spans 6,714 bytes and starts inside the quoted command. So the
