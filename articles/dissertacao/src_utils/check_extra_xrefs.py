"""check_extra_xrefs.py -- guard the frozen cross-volume references of the supplementary volume.

WHAT THIS EXISTS FOR
--------------------
src/main_extra.tex is a SEPARATE document carrying Appendix B (errata) and Appendix D (the
label-history benchmark). Those two appendices discuss chapters of the DISSERTATION, so they
contain \\ref{ch:cbic}, \\ref{ch:mobiwac}, \\ref{tab:mobiwac:results} and so on -- 46 call
sites whose targets live in a document this one does not read. src/main_extra.tex resolves them
by declaring frozen (label -> printed number) pairs with \\dissertationlabel.

A frozen number is exactly the kind of record that drifts (science/AGENT_HANDOFF.md §2.6:
page counts drifted four times, each caught by review rather than by the edit that caused
it). Reorder the chapters and the supplementary volume keeps printing "Chapter 3" for a
chapter that is now Chapter 4, with no warning from any build: both documents compile clean,
because each is internally consistent. Only a comparison ACROSS the two can see it.

THE THREE DIRECTIONS IT CHECKS
------------------------------
1. STALE   a label declared in main_extra.tex whose frozen number differs from the number the
           main defense build actually printed for it.
2. MISSING a \\ref target used by the supplementary volume's own sources that is neither
           defined inside that volume nor declared in main_extra.tex -- i.e. it would render
           as `??`.
3. DEAD    a label declared in main_extra.tex that nothing in the volume references any more.
           This direction matters because a dead declaration is what makes the other two
           look green: it is a value nobody is checking, kept alive by a gate that only
           compared declarations against the main build.

WHERE THE TRUTH COMES FROM
--------------------------
The number the MAIN build printed, read out of its own aux tree
(src/build/main-aux/**/*.aux, the \\newlabel lines), never from this file and never from
prose. If that tree is absent the gate SKIPS with a stated reason and a nonzero-free exit,
because a missing build is not a defect in the source -- but it says so out loud rather than
passing silently (AGENT_GUARDRAILS §4b V2: a skip is never silent).

SELF-TEST (AGENT_GUARDRAILS §4b V7, and it runs BEFORE the gate reports)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
--selftest builds three synthetic trees in a temp directory, one per direction, and asserts
this checker FAILS on each, then asserts it PASSES on a correct tree. A gate that has never
fired carries no information; four of this repository's checkers were wrong at least once by
being tuned only on the case in front of them.

Usage:
    python3 src_utils/check_extra_xrefs.py            # gate (runs the self-test first)
    python3 src_utils/check_extra_xrefs.py --selftest  # only the self-test
