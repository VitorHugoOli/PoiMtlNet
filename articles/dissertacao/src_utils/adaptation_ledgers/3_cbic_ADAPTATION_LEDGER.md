## A. Structural re-typeset changes (format only, no content change)

| # | Change | Where |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | Abstract and IEEEkeywords dropped (coletânea chapters carry no abstract; NORTH_STAR §3). The Acknowledgment section is also not carried (see A10). **Round 4 (REV-028):** the omission was recorded but never told to the reader; Appendix B's opening now states it for all three chapters at once. Verified 2026-07-26 in `articles/CBIC___MTL/main.tex`: abstract :43-45, IEEEkeywords :47-49, `\section*{Acknowledgment}` :77-78. | whole chapter |
| A2 | Paper `\section` levels became `\section` under the `\chapter`; labels renumbered to the chapter-prefixed scheme: `sec:related → sec:cbic:related`, `sec:methodology → sec:cbic:methodology`, `sec:mtl → sec:cbic:mtl`, `sec:method:mtl → sec:cbic:mtlarch`, `sec:nash_mtl → sec:cbic:nash`, `sec:experiments → sec:cbic:experiments`, `sec:conclusion → sec:cbic:conclusion`, `fig:arch → fig:cbic:arch`, `eq:loss → eq:cbic:loss`, `eq:nbs_objective → eq:cbic:nbs`, `table:cat → tab:cbic:category`, `table:next → tab:cbic:next`, `table:convergence_comparison → tab:cbic:convergence`. | whole chapter |
| A3 | "this paper" → "this chapter" (4 instances: §Intro "In this work, we investigate" → "In this chapter"; "contributions of this paper" → "of this chapter"; "The rest of this paper is organized" → "of this chapter"; §Method "This work computes" → "This chapter computes"; §Conclusion "In this paper, we introduced" → "In this chapter"). | intro, method, conclusion |
| A4 | Italic time-capsule preface added before §3.1 (`chapterpreface` environment): venue in full, DOI, first author, of-the-time framing, pointer to Chapters 4–5, one clause on the later Nash-MTL implementation finding (sanctioned by NORTH_STAR §4 Ch.3 claim-discipline note). Not part of the published text. | chapter opening |
| A5 | `IEEEeqnarray` (2-col line-broken DGI loss) reflowed to a single-line `equation` for 1-col; content identical. `\argmax` (paper-preamble macro) → `\operatorname*{arg\,max}` inline. `\resizebox` wrapper around the parameter-partition display removed (not needed at 1-col); the Θ_specific set line-broken for width. | method |
| A6 | Tables converted from vertical-ruled `tabular` + `\resizebox` to booktabs (no vertical rules), captions moved ABOVE tables (WRITING_LAW §5), captions rewritten as self-contained descriptions naming metric, spread convention, and bolding convention (original captions: "Table comparing the results of ..."). Cell values, bolding, and underlining copied verbatim from the published tables (see B7 for the one bolding-convention note). `{\ul ...}` (ulem) → `\underline{...}`. | results tables |
| A7 | Lead takeaway sentence added before the convergence table ("The convergence measurements show a clear wall-time disadvantage...") per WRITING_LAW §5 (tables introduced by a lead sentence); the two results tables were already introduced by the paper's own discussion paragraphs. | results |
| A8 | Figure: `figure*` (2-col span) → `figure`; `imgs/mtlnet_poi.drawio.png` copied to `figures/cbic_mtlnet_arch.png`; placed at `\textwidth` (the paper's figure* also spanned the full page width, so this is not a stretch; bitmap is 1200 px wide, ~200 dpi at text width — acceptable for a diagram, but flag: a TikZ/drawio re-export at higher resolution would be better; sources `mtlnet_poi_horizontal.drawio` / `_vertical.drawio` exist in `articles/CBIC___MTL/imgs/`). | method figure |
| A9 | Em-dashes and free-standing en-dashes removed per WRITING_LAW §1: challenge-list separators ("Negative Transfer — Unrelated..." etc.) → colons; parenthetical en-dashes in intro ("POIs – specific physical locations ... –") → commas; "Nash–MTL" heading → "Nash-MTL"; "$p_1$–$p_9$" → "$p_1$--$p_9$" (range en-dash kept in TeX form). | intro, basis, method |
| A10 | Commented-out draft blocks (old intro draft, section to-do notes in PT, commented citations) not carried over. Acknowledgment section not carried (frame-level matter). | whole chapter |

## B. Errata applied silently in the text (ERRATA.md non-citation set; each also lands in Appendix B)

| # | Erratum | Applied fix |
|---|---|---|
| B1 | Unfilled dataset placeholders `N_users`, `N_poi`, `N_checkins` in results.tex. | NOT invented. Rendered as visible placeholders "[$N_{\text{users}}$; VERIFY: recompute per ERRATA.md]" (same for poi/checkins) + a % comment block naming the sanctioned path (repo-committed recompute script over the CBIC-era Florida pipeline, author-approved; CoUrb FL row is cross-check only). **AUTHOR ACTION REQUIRED before handoff.** |
| B2 | Prose "almost four times more wall time" contradicts table (80.88 s vs 34.97 s = 2.3×). | Reconciled to the table: "required 80.88 s of wall time, about 2.3 times the cumulative 34.97 s of the individual single-task models." Values 80.88/16.26/18.71 from the published table; 34.97 and 2.3× quoted from ERRATA.md (not agent-computed). |
| B3 | Prose MFLOPs "roughly double" contradicts the table (MTL 0.234 vs Category 2.315 + Next 0.012). | Reconciled to the table: prose now states the table does not show a higher MFLOPs cost for MTL and quotes the three cell values verbatim. Follow-on edits for consistency: "incurred a significantly higher overhead in both time and computational resources" → "in wall time"; "where convergence speed and computational efficiency are critical factors" → "where convergence speed is a critical factor"; "a more convenient and resource-efficient strategy" → "a more convenient strategy"; §Conclusion "higher computational demands in terms of convergence time and MFLOPs" → "in terms of convergence wall time". |
| B4 | Broken cross-ref: `\label{sec:method:single_task_heads}` sat on the Dataset subsection, and method.tex pointed to it as if it described the task heads. | Dataset subsection relabeled `sec:cbic:dataset`; the dangling pointer sentence in §Method ("as detailed in Section~\ref{sec:method:single_task_heads}") dropped: "passed to dedicated, unshared task-specific heads. These heads generate...". No section describing single-task heads exists in the published paper, so no target could be substituted. |
| B5 | Typo "spatio-tegm\nmporal" in basis.tex. | → "spatio-temporal". |
| B6 | Nash-MTL claim discipline (NORTH_STAR §4). | The paper's own §Method sentence ("Nash-MTL consistently yielded a better overall performance") is preserved verbatim as published text; NOT amplified anywhere; the preface carries the one-clause of-the-time caution. |
| B7 | (Noted, not an ERRATA.md item) The published category table bolds the better of MTL/Single per row and never bolds HMRM, even where HMRM is numerically highest (Recall/Nightlife: HMRM 42.13 > Single 36.77 bold). Emphasis preserved exactly as published; the new caption states the convention explicitly so the bolding is not misread as "best per row". | tab:cbic:category |
| B8 | **NEW round 4 (REV-020a).** Factual correction in §3.3.4 Nash-MTL Optimizer, "Practical Aspects" paragraph (3_cbic.tex:237). Published (`sections/method.tex`): "Its reliance on gradient signs rather than scales inherently balances heterogeneous tasks without manual re-weighting." Nash-MTL does not read gradient signs; it is scale-invariant, which the SAME subsection states earlier at :224 ("scale-invariant to arbitrary loss re-weightings"), so the published text contradicted itself. | Chapter: "Its invariance to the scale of the individual task gradients, the second of the axioms listed above, balances heterogeneous tasks without manual re-weighting." Claim strength REDUCED (a mechanism claim is replaced by the property the source proves). Verified three ways 2026-07-26: (a) Navon et al., *Multi-Task Learning as a Bargaining Game*, arXiv:2202.01017 (PDF opened this session): Axiom 2.4 "Invariance to affine transformation" and the Fig. 1 discussion ("Our method, Nash-MTL, is invariant to changes in loss scale"); the token "sign" occurs in that paper **only** inside a bibliography entry for an unrelated method (gradient sign dropout, Chen et al. 2020). (b) `/Users/vitor/Desktop/mestrado/temp/tarik-new/PoiMtlNet_Novo/src/criterion/nash_mtl.py`: **zero** occurrences of `sign`/`abs`; `get_weighted_loss` (:176-232) stacks per-task gradients into G, forms `GTG = torch.mm(G, G.t())` (:222), divides by the Frobenius norm (:224-227) and solves for alpha (:228). (c) This repo's `src/losses/nash_mtl/loss.py`: same structure at :291-299, also **zero** `sign`. Declared as row 6 of Appendix B Table B.1 |

## C. Writing-law substitutions in preserved prose (minimal, lint-gate-driven; WRITING_LAW §4 banned words)

| # | Original (published) | Chapter text |
|---|---|---|
| C1 | "By leveraging shared information, MTL can potentially mitigate..." (intro) | "By using shared information, ..." |
| C2 | "solutions that leverage shared representations across related POI tasks" (basis) | "solutions that use shared representations..." |
| C3 | "by leveraging shared information across correlated tasks" (basis §MTL-in-POI) | "by sharing information across correlated tasks" |
| C4 | "Moreover, we utilize a Deep Graph Infomax..." / "Moreover, $\mathcal{D}$ is a discriminator..." (method) | "In addition, ..." (both) |
| C5 | "These findings underscore that..." (conclusion) | "These findings indicate that..." |
| C6 | "Furthermore, investigating advanced multi-task optimizers..." (conclusion) | "In addition, investigating..." |
| C7 | "Furthermore, the computational cost ... was roughly double" (results) | superseded by erratum B3 rewrite |
| C8 | "where different sequential patterns might be leveraged" (results) | "might be exploited" |
| C9 | **NEW round 4 (REV-027).** "the MTL framework does not deliver the consistent, significant gains often expected" (intro, 3_cbic.tex:62) | "does not deliver the consistent gains often expected" |
| C10 | **NEW round 4 (REV-027).** "both our MTL and Single models significantly outperform HMRM ... across all POI categories" (results, :302) | "both our MTL and Single models outperform HMRM ... in every POI category" |
| C11 | **NEW round 4 (REV-027).** "significantly surpassing MHA+PE in these categories" (results, :340) | "surpassing MHA+PE in these two categories" |
| C12 | **NEW round 4 (REV-027).** "suggesting that, statistically, the performance of the MTL and Single models is largely comparable, without a clear, consistent, and significant advantage" (results, :377) | "suggesting that the performance of the MTL and Single models is largely comparable, without a clear or consistent advantage" |
| C13 | **NEW round 4 (REV-010).** "Next-POI Prediction, in contrast, aims to predict which specific location a user is likely to visit next, given their past movement history." (related work, :81; published `sections/basis.tex`:23) | Sentence reproduced VERBATIM; a footnote was appended: "This states the general formulation of the task as the literature poses it. The variant studied in this chapter predicts the *category* of the next visited place rather than the place itself, as defined in Section 3.1 and in the chapter preface." |

**REV-027 scope note (round 4).** The chapter uses "significant/significantly" twelve times and
reports no inferential test anywhere: a grep for `p-value|p value|Wilcoxon|t-test|Holm|TOST|
confidence interval|statistical` over `3_cbic.tex` returned only :62 and :377, both of which
appealed to the word without naming a test and both of which are now corrected. Four uses were
substituted (C9-C12), all attaching significance to THIS study's own measured comparisons.
Untouched, with reasons: :90 and :209 attribute claims to cited work (Xu/Lim et al.; Caruana);
:60 states the study's own *hypothesis* ("will face significant limitations"), which is a
prediction about the outcome rather than a claim that a measured difference was tested, so
lowering it would misreport what the paper hypothesized; :68 makes a claim about task
dissimilarity, not about a measured comparison; :237 states a property of Nash-MTL attributed to
`\cite{nash}`; :395 names a chosen target F1 level ("a comparable and significant level of
predictive performance"), not a comparison. Two further uses are borderline and were LEFT AS
PUBLISHED pending the author's call, since neither was in the approved set of four: :414 ("a
significantly higher overhead in wall time", a magnitude reading of the chapter's own 80.88 s
against 34.97 s) and :423 ("the lack of significant improvement", restating the null result).
**Chapter 4 contains ZERO occurrences of "signific*" (confirmed 2026-07-26) and needed nothing.**

**Preface pointer fix (round 4, NEW-4).** 3_cbic.tex:25-27 said the chapter's preference for
Nash-MTL is "a conclusion of the time ... and the following chapters do not rely on it". False
for Chapter 4, which trains with the Nash-MTL balancer (`4_courb.tex`:115, and :84 for the
MTLnet baseline). Corrected to name Chapter 5, which reports a fixed loss weighting and states
that no balancer, Nash-MTL included, improved on it (`5_mobiwac.tex`:180-186). This sentence is
dissertation-authored preface prose (ledger row A4), NOT reproduced published text, so it takes
**no** Appendix B errata row. Per the author's ruling this round, no Nash caveat was added to
Chapter 3 or Chapter 4 beyond this pointer fix.

## D. [VERIFY] / [NEEDS SIGN-OFF] items

1. **[VERIFY — blocks handoff]** B1 dataset statistics: `N_users`, `N_poi`, `N_checkins` must be
   recomputed by the sanctioned repo script and author-approved before the placeholders are
   replaced. Visible in the rendered PDF by design.
2. **[NEEDS SIGN-OFF]** B4: the dangling task-heads cross-reference was resolved by deletion
   (no valid target exists in the published paper). Alternative: point to §3.3.2 (the MTL
   architecture's task-heads paragraph) if the author prefers a pointer over deletion.
3. **[NEEDS SIGN-OFF]** Preface wording, in particular the Nash-MTL clause ("weakened by a
   later finding about the optimizer implementation") — the solver-bug detail (repo memory
   2026-04-10) is deliberately not spelled out; confirm the level of specificity wanted.
4. **[FLAG]** A8: `cbic_mtlnet_arch.png` is a 1200×336 px bitmap (~200 dpi at text width).
   Legible, but a higher-resolution re-export from the .drawio sources would be better for the
   final build.
5. **[RECOMMENDATION, round 4 — author's call, NOT applied]** The same sentence corrected in B8
   also claims Nash-MTL "requires only two matrix-vector products per iteration" (3_cbic.tex:237).
   The phrase does not occur in Navon et al. (arXiv:2202.01017, full text searched this session),
   and the claim understates the per-step cost: both implementations run an iterative
   concave-convex procedure with `optim_niter = 20` by default, each pass a cvxpy/ECOS solve
   (`temp/tarik-new/PoiMtlNet_Novo/src/criterion/nash_mtl.py`:99 and :126-141; this repo's
   `src/losses/nash_mtl/loss.py`:105 and :158-200). The paper itself reports that raising the CCP
   sequence to 20 iterations lifts the share of optimal solutions from 91.5% to 93.5%, and it
   devotes §3.3 ("Practical Speedup") to the cost of the step. Whether to correct a published
   cost claim is a judgment call, so it was left as published and raised in the handoff instead.
6. **[BIBLIOGRAPHY-ADJACENT FINDING, round 4 — reported, not acted on; references.bib is another
   track's file]** 3_cbic.tex:108 cites `\cite{nash,standley2020tasks}` for the "Data
   Heterogeneity" challenge ("Variations in modality, label granularity, and dataset size
   complicate sampling strategies and minibatch construction"). Navon et al. do **not** establish
   that: the tokens "modalit", "minibatch", "heterogen", "dataset size", "label granular", and
   "sampling" return **zero** hits in the full text of arXiv:2202.01017 (checked this session).
   That paper is about gradient conflict and the bargaining solution, not about data
   heterogeneity. The co-cite `standley2020tasks` (*Which Tasks Should Be Learned Together in
   Multi-Task Learning?*) is the plausible support for a task-grouping claim, though it was not
   opened this session. Recommendation for the references track: either drop `nash` from this
   particular co-cite, or re-source the sentence. No bib entry was added or changed here.
7. **[NOTE]** Citation errata #1–#9 (ERRATA.md) untouched here; keys `velivckovic2017graph`,
   `velivckovic2018deep`, `nash`, `yu2019mmoe`, `chen2020modeling`, `misra2016cross`,
   `zhang2021survey` etc. appear in this chapter exactly as in the paper and await the Phase-4
   global bib merge.
