r"""Gate `\finalbuildfirstpage` -- the number the first body page of the DEPOSIT build prints.

WHY THIS EXISTS, and it is not a hypothetical risk
--------------------------------------------------
`src/main.tex` sets the printed page number of the first body page of `main_academico.pdf`. That
number has now been "corrected" FOUR times -- 11, then 8, then 9, then 10 -- and every one of the
first three was wrong. The fourth (10) was also wrong: the RASCUNHO measured on 2026-09-06 shows
the correct value is 20.

Three things made that possible, and this file answers all three.

1. THE RECIPE IN THE SOURCE TAUGHT THE WRONG METHOD. The comment above the macro said: count the
   pre-textual pages of `build/main_academico.pdf` and add one. Our PDF contributes NINE unnumbered
   pages, so that recipe yields 10 -- and 10 is what it yielded, consistently, while being wrong by
   exactly the pages the recipe cannot see. AcademicoPG PREPENDS its own front matter to whatever we
   upload, and the UFV manual counts those pages. They are not in our file, so no amount of measuring
   our file will ever reveal them.

2. THE MACRO'S OWN COMMENT CLAIMED A GATE THAT DID NOT EXIST. It read "src_utils/_round6/
   VERIFY_LIST.md item A4 carries the command, and check.sh runs it, which is how this was caught."
   Verified 2026-09-06 by listing every script `check.sh` invokes: nothing checked this number.
   `sync_page_counts.py` checks page TOTALS, never the first-page NUMBER. A false claim that a guard
   exists is worse than no guard, because it makes each successive wrong value feel verified.

3. THE ONE GATE THAT DOES RUN IS INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM ITS OWN MISSING-BUILD ERROR. To be precise,
   and correcting a wrong statement made earlier the same day: `sync_page_counts.py` does NOT exit 0
   when a build is missing -- it exits 1 and `check.sh` records FAIL. The problem is subtler. It
   `sys.exit`s on the FIRST missing build, and `main_ppgc.pdf` is routinely absent, so the run ends
   before any count is compared. Its failure for "you did not build ppgc" looks exactly like its
   failure for "a recorded number is wrong", so the noise trains a reader to skip it. This file
   therefore separates the two outcomes explicitly: a missing build exits 2 ("cannot check"), a
   real disagreement exits 1 ("wrong"). They must never be confused again.

WHAT THE UFV RULE ACTUALLY IS
-----------------------------
Manual de entrega, §7, and `UFV_COMPLIANCE.md:37`:
  - pre-textual pages are COUNTED but NOT NUMBERED;
  - the cover and the ficha catalográfica are NEITHER counted NOR numbered;
  - the first body page therefore prints (counted pre-textual pages) + 1.

So the number depends on the ASSEMBLED document, not on ours.

THE ARITHMETIC, from the RASCUNHO of 2026-09-06 (127 sheets, watermarked, system-emitted)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    127 sheets  =  11 prepended by the system  +  116 ours
     11 prepended  =  1 cover (not counted)  +  10 counted
    counted pre-textual  =  10 (system)  +  9 (ours, unnumbered)  =  19
    first body page prints  =  19 + 1  =  20

Cross-check, independently: the last sheet is 127; only the cover is uncounted; so it is counted
page 126. From the other end, 20 + 107 - 1 = 126, where 107 is our body pages (116 - 9). The two
paths agree, which is what makes 20 trustworthy rather than merely measured.

THE FICHA DOES NOT MOVE THIS NUMBER. When the Library attaches it there will be 128 sheets, but the
ficha is inserted before the body and is not counted: 128 - cover - ficha = 126 still, and the first
body page still prints 20. It shifts the physical index only. Do not "correct" this value when the
ficha arrives.

WHAT THIS GATE CANNOT DO, stated so nobody trusts it further than it goes
------------------------------------------------------------------------
`SYSTEM_COUNTED_SHEETS` below is NOT derivable from anything in this repository. It is a property of
what AcademicoPG generates, and the only authority is a system-emitted RASCUNHO. It is pinned here
with its provenance, and the manual says so twice: "a referência correta para a numeração das páginas
deve ser sempre o arquivo emitido pelo sistema." If the portal's front matter changes -- a new field,
a second signature sheet -- this constant is stale and this gate will confidently certify a wrong
number. RE-MEASURE IT AGAINST A FRESH RASCUNHO whenever the portal's front matter might have changed,
and record the new measurement here rather than adjusting the macro to match.

Run:  python3 src_utils/check_first_body_page.py     (from articles/dissertacao/, or via check.sh)
Exit: 0 agree · 1 the macro disagrees with the rule · 2 cannot check (missing build / unreadable)
