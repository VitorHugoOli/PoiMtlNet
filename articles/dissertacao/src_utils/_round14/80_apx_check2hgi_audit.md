# Round 14 — audit of Appendix E, "How Check2HGI and the Joint Model Work"

**Scope.** Every technical claim in `src/chapters/apx_h_check2hgi_joint_model.tex` re-measured
against the live implementation, plus a visual audit of the two figures in the rendered PDF. The
appendix renders as **Appendix E**, pages 107-116 of the 116-page defense build.

**Method.** Claims were read from the appendix source, then located in the code by grep and read in
place. Paths below are relative to the repository root (`/Users/vitor/Desktop/mestrado/ingred`).
The figures were audited by rendering `build/main.pdf` pages to images and looking at them, not by
reading the TikZ source, because the defects found are collisions that only exist in the output.

---

## 1 · Defects found

| # | Where | Defect | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **D1** | `apx_h:eq:apx-region-fusion` | `\mathbf{W}_{mathrm{shr}}` is missing the backslash on `\mathrm`. **Not a TeX error** — it compiles silently and prints as italic literal `mathrmshr` in the PDF (visible on rendered p. 113). The symbol is written correctly (`\mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{shr}}`) in the very next sentence that defines it, so the equation and its own legend disagree. | rendered p. 113, Eq. (E.4) |
| **D2** | appendix-wide | **The region-transition prior being OFF is never stated.** `freeze_alpha=True` and `alpha_init=0.0` appear nowhere in the appendix (`grep -n "alpha\|prior\|log_T\|transition"` over the file returns nothing). `CHAMPION.md:37` calls prior-OFF a key lever worth **~+1.4 pp region**, and `mtl_v17_complete_picture.md:171-181` devotes a section to it. A table headed "Reproduction-critical settings" that omits a +1.4 pp switch is not reproduction-critical. | `docs/studies/archive/mtl_improvement/CHAMPION.md:37`; `science/mtl_v17_complete_picture.md:171-181` |
| **D3** | `apx_h`, §E.3.2 (Step 2) | Prose says the attention module "uses one learned seed query **for every place**". The code has **one seed shared across all places**: `self.S = nn.Parameter(torch.Tensor(1, hidden_channels))`, whose own comment reads "Learnable seed vector (shared query for all POIs)". A per-place seed would be `(num_pois, D)`. This is a factual error about the mechanism, not a wording preference. | `research/embeddings/check2hgi/model/Checkin2POI.py:45-47`, and `:104` "Project Q (shared seed)" |
| **D4** | Figure 9 (`figures/check2hgi_flow.tex`) | **Node overlap in the render.** The export row collides with the hierarchy row above it: "Exported check-in table" overprints `$\mathbf{x}_i\in\mathbb{R}^{64}$`, and "Detached place summary" overprints the `$\mathcal{L}_{P\!R}$` label and the words "region adjacency", which are clipped. Cause: nodes are placed at hardcoded `y=1.25` / `y=-1.35` with `minimum height=1.35cm`, but the "Spatial context" node carries four text lines and grows past its slot. | rendered p. 109 |
| **D5** | Figure 10 (`figures/joint_model_flow.tex`) | **Label collisions in the render.** (a) the "two blocks" exchange label sits on top of the "$9\times256$" text of the category node; (b) the "Shared route" and "Private route" nodes touch with no gap, reading as one box; (c) the "raw-region bypass" label is struck through by its own dashed arrow. | rendered p. 112 |

## 2 · Discrepancy in a theory document, not in the appendix

**T1 — GRU depth. The appendix is right and `mtl_v17_complete_picture.md` is stale.**

- Appendix: "a four-layer unidirectional GRU with input and hidden width 256" (§E.5.3), and the
  settings table row "Four-layer GRU; hidden width 256".
- `science/mtl_v17_complete_picture.md:409` (§11 checklist): "`next_gru` category head, hidden width
  256, **two layers**."
- Code: the head's own default is `num_layers: int = 2`
  (`src/models/next/next_gru/head.py:18`), **but the head does not use its default** — `num_layers`
  is injected from the model-level parameter by `_build_category_head`
  (`src/models/mtl/mtlnet/model.py:161-166`, `:243`), and the MTL experiment config sets
  **`"num_layers": 4`** (`src/configs/experiment.py:428`). The v17 reproduction command
  (`mtl_v17_complete_picture.md:353-390`) passes no `--num-layers`, so the config default stands.

So the rendered dissertation is correct and the theory document's checklist line is wrong. Recorded
here rather than "fixed" in the appendix, because the fix belongs in the theory document and it is
the author's file. **Flagged for the author, not applied.**

## 2b · The appendix is unreachable from the document, and that is an author decision

**T2 — no chapter points at it.** Measured over live prose with comments stripped, across every file
under `src/chapters/`: the label `apx:check2hgi-joint-model` is referenced **zero** times outside its
own `\label` declaration. For contrast, the gradient-cosine appendix is pointed at from four places
(`1_introduction.tex:448`, `2_fundamentals.tex:1023`, `5_mobiwac/02_related.tex:25`,
`6_conclusion.tex:242`). So a reader reaching Appendix E has no route into it from the argument, and
nothing tells them the walk-through exists.

The natural host is Chapter 5, whose method section is what the appendix expands. **NOT APPLIED here**
for two reasons: Chapter 5 is the under-review MobiWac chapter, whose errata regime reserves changes
to its body (`NORTH_STAR` §4), and choosing where to send the reader is an editorial call.
**Flagged for the author.** One sentence in `5_mobiwac/04_method.tex` or in the Chapter 5 preface
would close it.

Separately, and cosmetic: the file is named `apx_h_check2hgi_joint_model.tex` but prints as
**Appendix E**, because B, D, and G moved to the supplementary volume and the printed letters now run
A, B, C, D, E over files A, C, E, F, H. Nothing depends on the filename and no letter is hardcoded
anywhere, so this is a naming wart rather than a defect. Renaming it would touch `content.tex:398`
and nothing else.

### Notation consistency with the rest of the dissertation

The check-in tuple $c_i=(u_i,p_i,l_i,g_i,t_i)$, the place embedding $\mathbf{e}_{p_i}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}$
and the check-in vector notation are used in the appendix in the same shapes the frame chapters use.
The appendix writes the widths concretely as $\mathbb{R}^{64}$ rather than the symbolic $d$/$d'$,
which is consistent with its stated purpose (an operational walk-through) and does not conflict.

## 4 · What was NOT checked, and why

- **Numerical results.** The appendix reports no result cells, so the number protocol has nothing to
  audit here. The one quantitative claim about outcomes (`+1.4 pp` for prior-OFF) is in THIS report,
  quoted from `CHAMPION.md`, and is deliberately NOT put into the appendix prose.
- **Whether the reported runs used these exact files.** Same limit as the round-4 CoUrb seed finding:
  the code on disk is evidence of what the code does, not proof of which commit produced the board.
  No claim in this report asserts otherwise.
- **The `aux_proj` weight-decay detail.** `mtl_v17_complete_picture.md:167` states β receives the
  normal 0.05 decay. The appendix does not mention β's decay at all, which is an omission rather than
  an error, and adding it was judged below the reproduction-critical bar. Noted, not applied.

## 6 · Second pass: what the figures were missing (author-raised)

**D6 — Figure 9 showed the stages but never named the levels.** Raised by the author after the
layout fix landed. Section E.2 builds its whole explanation on "four node levels" and "the four
resolutions of the representation" (check-in, place, region, city) and on the membership chain
"every check-in belongs to one place, every retained place belongs to one region, and every region
belongs to the city". None of that vocabulary appeared in the figure, so a reader could not map the
prose onto the boxes.

Two additions, both verified in the render (p. 110):

1. **A hierarchy spine** across the top: `check-in` $c_i$ → `place` $p$ → `region` $r$ → `city`
   $\Omega$, with each containment arrow labelled by the objective that spans that boundary
   ($\mathcal{L}_{CP}$, $\mathcal{L}_{PR}$, $\mathcal{L}_{R\Omega}$). The labelling is not
   decorative: the three discriminators are defined across exactly these level pairs
   (`alpha_c2p`, `alpha_p2r`, `alpha_r2c` at `check2hgi.py:1001-1003`), so the spine reads directly
   against Equation E.2 instead of needing a separate legend.
2. **A level tag on each processing box** (`raw records`, `check-in level`, `place level`,
   `region level`, `city level`), set inside the box rather than beside it, because an outside label
   would sit in a band gap where it could collide with an arrow, which is the defect class D4/D5
   were about.

The caption now describes both. Band `minimum height` was raised from 2.8cm to 3.3cm to absorb the
extra text line; without that the tags would have clipped, reintroducing D4.

**Gate note.** The first caption wording, "each processing stage is tagged with the level it works
at", tripped `check_register.py` as a stranded-preposition shape (a Class B hard-phrasing hit under
WRITING_LAW §1) and made `make check` exit 2 with zero FAIL lines in the summary. Rewritten to
"carries a tag naming its own level". Worth recording because rc=2 with no visible FAIL is easy to
misread as an infrastructure problem rather than a register hit.

## 7 · Final state

| Target | rc | pages | tex_errors | Overfull |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `defense` | 0 | 117 | 0 | 0 |
| `academico` | 0 | 114 | 0 | 0 |
| `ppgc` | 0 | 118 | 0 | 0 |
| `extra` | 0 | 26 | 0 | 0 |
| `make check` | 0 | — | — | 0 FAIL lines |
| `make selftest` | 0 | — | — | required set passes |

The three main-volume targets each gained one page against the pre-round baseline (116 / 113 / 117),
because Table 12 gained the prior-OFF row and reflowed. `extra` is unchanged.

**Left for the author, deliberately:** T1 (the stale two-layer GRU line in
`science/mtl_v17_complete_picture.md:409`) and T2 (no chapter points at Appendix E).

## 8 · Overleaf log findings (author-supplied, TeX Live 2025)

The author's Overleaf build reports warnings this tree does not. **Cause: version skew.**
Overleaf runs TeX Live 2025, this tree runs TeX Live 2026 (`pdfTeX 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.29`).
Babel and the font metrics differ between them, and line breaking follows. **For anything
submitted, the Overleaf log is authoritative, not this one.**

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| `Overfull \hbox (9.27821pt too wide)` at `1_introduction.tex:158-162` | **FIXED at source, version-independently.** Local TL2026 reports zero Overfull boxes for that paragraph, so the defect could not be reproduced here and no local measurement could confirm a fix. Hyphenation points were therefore added for the paragraph's long words (`preamble.tex`, after the existing `\hyphenation{fe-de-ral}`), which changes no wording and only widens the set of lines TeX may choose. `dimensional` is the load-bearing entry: it follows an explicit hyphen in "64-dimensional", and TeX does not hyphenate the remainder of a word after an explicit hyphen unless the parts are given. **Confirm on Overleaf.** |
| `Package babel Warning: Last declared language option is 'brazil', but the last processed one was 'english'` | **NOT changed. Author decision needed.** This is a real latent ambiguity, not noise: `brazil` and `english` are both class options (`preamble.tex:38-39`), `brazil` is declared last but `english` is processed last, which is exactly why the preamble needs the `\addto\captionsbrazil` block to anglicize captions by hand. `main=english` was TESTED here: rc=0, 116 pages, warning gone, Portuguese `Resumo`/`Palavras-chave` intact, English captions intact, zero hyphenation change on page 2. It was reverted rather than shipped, because the warning does not fire on TL2026 and a babel main-language change should be verified where it actually fires. Apply and confirm on Overleaf. |
| `Underfull \hbox` at `content.tex:121`, `3_cbic/method.tex:16` (x2), `4_courb.tex:2` | **Pre-existing, previously audited, no action.** The first is front matter; the two in `3_cbic/method.tex` are inside a footnote about the released implementation's neighbor mean. Underfull boxes are loose spacing, not overrun text, and none of these is in the appendix under audit. |

**Note on parallel builds.** `latexbuild.sh:33` gives every target its own `build/<stem>-aux`,
added (per its own header note) because concurrent builds previously corrupted each other's
aux files. Building the four targets concurrently is therefore safe and is what this round
does. The one caveat: do not run two builds of the SAME target at once, which produced a
spurious `ppgc: rc=2` earlier in this session.
