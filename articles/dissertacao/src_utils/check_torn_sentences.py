"""Detect a body line that begins mid-sentence: a torn sentence whose opening clause is GONE.

WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY check_trapped_prose.py CANNOT DO IT
------------------------------------------------------------
check_trapped_prose.py finds prose trapped AFTER the last `%` on a comment line. That is a different
defect from this one. Here the text is not trapped anywhere: it is simply absent, the line above is
ordinary body text, and the build is clean.

It happened on 2026-07-27 in the Resumo and Abstract, rendered pages 3 and 4, four times. An
assistant compressing those blocks replaced a span that ENDED at a sentence terminator, and the
replacement dropped the following sentence's opening clause. The page rendered:

    "... through multi-task learning (MTL). sharing parameters between tasks can hurt one of them ..."
    "... at the other two. condition is the finding: whether multi-task learning helps ..."

Two things make this class dangerous. The abstract is the first prose a committee member reads, and
persona 03 found it only because it read the front matter as RENDERED prose rather than as source.

The rule below was proposed by persona 03 in its v3 report and is implemented as it specified: a body
line beginning with a lowercase word whose preceding non-blank body line ends in a sentence
terminator. On the repaired tree it returns zero; on the damaged tree it returned exactly the four
real defects and nothing else.

Usage:  python3 src_utils/check_torn_sentences.py [chapter.tex ...]
Exit 1 when any suspect is found.
