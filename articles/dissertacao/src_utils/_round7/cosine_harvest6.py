"""cosine_harvest6.py -- build the six-dataset parquet, with the fold-distinctness gate FIRST.

WHY THIS GATE EXISTS, measured on this project. Earlier this round two per-fold jobs on the GPU
host both resolved their output directory by RECENCY (`find ... -newer sentinel | head -1`), which
races under concurrent jobs, and `--only-fold k` names its output `fold1_diagnostics.csv` for every
k -- so the filename carries no fold identity. Two jobs harvested the SAME run directory and
produced BYTE-IDENTICAL files claiming to be different folds (md5 2afa6aebfb2a2c2145a104c3a54f50f6
for both california_f2 and california_f3). Those files are still on the host and this script would
accept them without the checks below. The data was discarded rather than reported.

THE GATE, and every leg is a hard assertion rather than a warning:
  (1) every per-fold CSV's md5 is distinct -- two identical files across folds is a harvest fault,
      not a result, no matter how well-formed they are;
  (2) each file's own fold column equals the fold it is filed under -- a filename is a claim, the
      column is evidence. (The runner writes fold identity into the PATH, not into a column, so the
      check is: the file came from <rundir>/diagnostics/fold<k>_diagnostics.csv of a run directory
      resolved by the training process's own pid, and its epoch column is a complete 1..50 series.)
  (3) the cosine column carries numbers -- exit status, row count and header shape are ALL satisfied
      by an all-NaN column, which is exactly what three earlier runs produced (the diagnostic is
      opt-in and defaults off).
A fold failing any leg is DISCARDED and named in the output, never silently dropped.

Usage:  python3 src_utils/_round7/cosine_harvest6.py <newdata_dir> [out.parquet]
        where <newdata_dir> holds <state>_fold<k>_diagnostics.csv files harvested from the host.

THE SECOND ARGUMENT IS NOT A CONVENIENCE. Validating this gate needs a synthetic clean case (three
states, five distinct folds each) to prove the gate PASSES data it should pass -- and the first run
of that validation wrote 4,650 rows of `numpy.random.default_rng(0)` output to the production
parquet path, where nothing downstream would have distinguished it from measurement. It was deleted
and re-run with an explicit destination. Any self-test MUST pass its own output path.
