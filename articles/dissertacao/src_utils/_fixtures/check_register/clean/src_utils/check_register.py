"""check_register.py -- the register law: American English, and phrasing a non-native reader takes
in on one reading.

THE TWO DEFECTS IT ANSWERS, both found by the author reading Appendix F in the rendered PDF on
2026-07-30 (PENDENCIAS_RESOLVIDOS 2.22 (arquivado 2026-07-30) points 8, 9 and 12), and neither covered by any rule at the time.
Measured before the rule was written: `grep -cin "british"` over WRITING_LAW.md and
AGENT_GUARDRAILS.md returned 0 and 0. WRITING_LAW §1 said "American English throughout" and named
no British form; nothing at all addressed the second complaint.

  (a) BRITISH ENGLISH. His instance: "feature needs saying plainly". Note what it is NOT: not a
      spelling. It is the British `need`+gerund construction, where American English writes
      "needs to be said plainly". A spelling list would have missed it entirely, so this gate
      covers spellings AND constructions.

  (b) PHRASING A NON-NATIVE WRITER WOULD NOT PRODUCE, which forces a non-native reader to read
      twice. His instances: "Two departures from that flat picture appear" (his note: "pure A.I,
      we can be more simple"), and "Both point away from trouble in any case. A positive cosine is
      mild cooperation, not conflict, and the decline stays inside the margin throughout while
      moving toward zero rather than away from it." (his note: "well written, but is not natural
      for a non native writer in english, and force a non native read more than once").

WHICH HALF IS MECHANICAL, stated plainly because a docstring claiming more coverage than the code
has is itself a defect this repository has shipped:

  CLASS A -- British spellings and constructions -- IS MECHANICAL and is gated hard. A word either
  is the British form or is not. Every family is checked, and the ones that would over-fire on
  American text (the -ise and -our families, whose American members are ordinary words) are
  generated and then filtered through an explicit whitelist rather than hand-listed, because a
  hand-typed list only finds the wording its author imagined (AGENT_GUARDRAILS §4b V17).

  CLASS B -- hard phrasing -- IS PARTLY JUDGMENT. Four shapes are expressible and are gated: a
  delayed subject before a clause-final appearance verb, native-literary idiom, chained
  qualification inside one sentence, and an abstract noun as the agent of a motion verb. What is
  NOT expressible, and is NOT claimed here, is the general question of whether a sentence reads
  on the first pass. That belongs to the readability editor's first-read method
  (`reviewers/15_readability_editor.md`, lens 2, verdict PASS / NEEDS REVISION), which this gate
  points at instead of duplicating. A green Class B is not a first-read PASS.

NOT GATED, ON PURPOSE, and reported to the author instead (see _round9/44_register_law.md):
quotation-final period placement. American style puts the period inside the closing quotation
mark; 13 sites in this tree put it outside. All 13 sit in errata tables and correction rows where
the quoted string is the evidence, and moving a period inside a quotation alters the quotation.
That is a decision about the errata convention, not a spelling error, so it is the author's.

SCOPE INCLUDES THE BIBLIOGRAPHY, and the reason is a finding in itself. This gate first covered
`src/**/*.tex` only and reported clean while `towards` printed on page 82 of the defense build: the
bibliography is not a .tex file. So `references.bib` is swept too, but ONLY the fields we author
(note, annote, abstract, howpublished, addendum). `title`, `booktitle`, `journal`, `series` and
`author` are attributes of record under §1 R2, and the one British form in this bibliography sits in
Xu2023's title, whose title of record at Crossref (10.1145/3582553, checked 2026-07-30) reads
"towards". Correcting it would corrupt an attribute the citation protocol requires be exact.

SCOPE AND THE TRAPS IT AVOIDS, each of which produced a wrong verdict on this project before:
  1. comments are stripped with the same `(?<!\\)%` rule the audit gate uses, because this tree's
     provenance comments quote the very sentences under review (this file's docstring would trip a
     comment-blind checker).
  2. lines are JOINED before matching: a phrase that wraps is invisible to a per-line regex, and
     that trap has produced false verdicts in both directions here.
  3. verbatim quotations (``...'') are masked for the SPELLING families only. A quotation of
     published wording may not be altered, so a British spelling inside one is not this gate's
     business. Constructions and Class B shapes still read the full text.
  4. scope is derived from the filesystem with a FLOOR, never typed. A chapter split silently
     shrank two prose gates' scope on this project and both reported a clean sweep of almost
     nothing.

THE OPEN REGISTER, and it retires itself. Some hits are not this gate's to fix: the two Appendix F
files are owned by a parallel track, and one hit sits in verbatim reproduced published prose where
a change costs an errata row and is the author's call. Those are listed in OPEN_REGISTER with an
owner, printed as OPEN, and excluded from the failure count -- a skip is never silent
(AGENT_GUARDRAILS §4b V7). The entry is self-retiring: when the defect is GONE the gate FAILS and
tells you to delete the entry, so a stale exemption cannot sit there hiding a future regression.
