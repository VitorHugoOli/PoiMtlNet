"""check_verify_list.py -- run every command documented in VERIFY_LIST.md and PENDENCIAS.md,
and compare what it returns against what the document says it should return.

WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-07-28 three separate commands written into the author-facing verification
documents did not answer the question they were annotated with:

  * a count of \path{} entries annotated "# 13" returned 15, because it did not strip the appendix's
    own provenance comments, which mention \path{} while explaining the count;
  * a "four of six" sweep promised 3 prose hits and returned 4, one an indented comment;
  * a "three of our six" sweep promised ZERO prose hits and returned 5, every one an audit comment.

Each was individually plausible. What made them survive is that nothing ran them. A verification
document nobody executes is a claim, not a check -- the same failure this repository has now recorded
for its build reporter, four checker globs, and a page-count syncer.

WHAT IT CHECKS. For each fenced bash block carrying a machine-checkable EXPECT annotation (see below),
the block is run from its declared working directory and its output compared against the expectation.
Blocks without an EXPECT annotation are still RUN, and reported as executed-not-asserted, so the count
of what was actually verified is never overstated.

RECURSION. This gate is invoked from check.sh, and two documented blocks invoke check.sh (or
`make check`) themselves -- which is correct for the author, since checking that the gate suite passes
is one of the things the list tells him to do. Running them from inside the harness re-enters check.sh,
which re-enters the harness, and the run does not terminate. I built exactly that cycle on 2026-07-28
and it hung `make check` for ten minutes before I noticed.

So the harness SKIPS any block that invokes `check.sh` or `make check`, and reports them as skipped
with the reason rather than silently -- an unreported skip counted as a pass is the defect this file
was written to answer. Those two blocks are exercised every time check.sh itself runs, which is the
only place they can be exercised without recursion.

THE ANNOTATION. Add a comment line inside the bash block:

    # EXPECT: lines=3
    # EXPECT: contains=RC=0
    # EXPECT: equals=13

Supported: lines=N (exactly N non-empty output lines), contains=STR, equals=STR (whole stripped
output). Multiple EXPECT lines all have to hold. A block with no annotation is executed only.

# WHICH COMMANDS COUNT AS "a build" -- and this list was INCOMPLETE, which is the whole defect.
# The build guard below has existed since round 7 and its comment correctly says running a build
# here "took make check from 4 seconds to 297". But it tested for `make defense`, `make final`,
# `make ppgc` and `pdflatex` by substring, and two blocks added to PENDENCIAS.md afterwards open
# with `make fast3 && bash src_utils/build.sh src both` -- neither of which matched. So the guard
# reported nothing, the harness built all three targets and then rebuilt two more, on EVERY
# `make check`.
#
# Measured 2026-07-30: 264.1 s of a 265.5 s suite, 99.5 percent, against 0.927 s for the same gate
# in round 7. The lesson is not "add fast3": it is that a substring list of the CURRENT target names
# is guaranteed to go stale the next time a target is added, which is exactly what happened. Hence
# one pattern, covering the Makefile's build targets as a class plus the two scripts and pdflatex.
#
# The cost was not only the clock. A gate that rebuilds the PDFs is a gate that COLLIDES with any
# other build, which is the source of every intermittent rc=1 chased this round: the suite
# rewriting build/*.pdf underneath its own page-count and numbering checks.
#
# Refused rather than skipped-in-silence, and reported with this reason, because the block itself
# is CORRECT for the author -- he should run that recipe. It just must not run here.
#
# ROUND 8: the target ALTERNATION was widened last round but the `make` invocation itself was still
# assumed to be bare, so `make -C src defense` and `make --directory=src defense` fell through to
# kind="run" and were executed in full. Same defect one level up: a guard that matches the argument
# and not the way the tool is called. `make` now tolerates any options before the target, and the
# target list is a negative test (anything that is NOT one of the handful of known cheap targets
# counts as a build) so the next target added is guarded on the day it is added rather than the day
# someone measures the suite.

# THE FIXTURE TABLE THIS FILE'S OWN COMMENT PROMISED.
#
# ROUND 8, 2026-07-30. The comment at the top of MUTATING said the six escaped shapes were
# "measured with a 29-case fixture table (`--selftest` below)". There was no `--selftest` below,
# and no table. `main()` reads no argv at all, so `check_verify_list.py --selftest` parsed nothing,
# ran the ordinary gate, printed the ordinary report and exited 0 -- indistinguishable from a
# passing self-test to anyone who checked the exit code. That is this round's own failure mode
# reproduced inside the tool built to catch it: a durable record asserting a measurement that was
# never taken. selftest_all.py independently lists check_verify_list among the four checkers with
# NOTHING, which is the reading to trust.
#
# Every MUTATING row below is one of the six shapes that walked past the pre-round pattern, or a
# guard against a regression that would let it walk again. Every BUILDING and RECURSING row is a
# call-shape (`-C`, `--directory=`, `-f`) that classified as "run" before round 8. The NEGATIVE
# rows matter as much: a guard that refuses everything is not a guard, and three of them
# (`> /dev/null`, `2>&1`, `git log`/`git show`/`git diff` reads) are shapes this file's own
# documented blocks depend on -- if a widening breaks those, the harness stops verifying anything.
