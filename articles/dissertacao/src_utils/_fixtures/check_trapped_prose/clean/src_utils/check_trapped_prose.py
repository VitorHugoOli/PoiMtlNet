"""Detect prose accidentally trapped inside a LaTeX comment line.

WHY: this failure is SILENT. The build succeeds, no warning is emitted, and the reader gets a
sentence that stops mid-clause or a disclosure that never appears. It has now bitten this document
EIGHT times, every one of them from an edit that inserted an audit comment:

  apx_a_contributions.tex   a sentence FRAGMENT appended after a comment's terminal period
  4_courb.tex:187           half a PUBLISHED methodology sentence, dropping three method facts
  5_mobiwac.tex:385         four sentences including a required three-limits disclosure
  4_courb.tex:311 and :362  two PUBLISHED results passages, about 270 words
  2_fundamentals.tex:366    ", Nash-MTL treats"                       (3 words)
  6_conclusion.tex:105      "a capacity-matched dedicated baseline..." (7 words)
  apx_b_errata.tex:188      "The emphasis convention of the..."        (9 words)
  6_conclusion.tex:110      "Second,"                                  (ONE word, and the tool was
                            already in place and still missed it: the word floor was 2, so a
                            swallowed sentence-opener slipped under it)

THE ROOT CAUSE IS ALWAYS THE SAME: a comment block written without a trailing newline, so the body
line that followed got pulled onto the last comment line.

WHAT DOES *NOT* WORK AS A DISCRIMINATOR, learned by shipping each one and being caught:
  - vocabulary filters: ledger commentary and trapped prose are both English about the same
    subject. Filters either flooded (40 false positives) or silenced a real case.
  - "the tail must be a complete sentence": misses fragments (apx_a, and ", Nash-MTL treats").
  - "the tail must not contain parentheses": misses "...distinct counties (GEOIDs)."
  - LINE LENGTH / block-median overshoot: misses SHORT tails. The three cases above are 38, 124
    and 88 characters, at or below their blocks' own median width. This is the trap: tuning a
    length threshold on the long cases makes the checker blind to the short ones, and a
    three-word tail breaks a sentence just as thoroughly as a 270-word one.

THE TEST THAT ACTUALLY WORKS is the definition of the bug, with no proxy in between: take the words
that follow the LAST `%` on a comment line, and ask whether they appear in the rendered PDF. Body
text reaches the PDF; a comment never does. To keep ledger commentary from firing, require the
candidate to look like a continuation of the surrounding document rather than a note about it:
the words must run on into the NEXT source line, which is what makes it a torn sentence rather
than a self-contained remark.

VALIDATION. Do not write a validation record here before running it. An earlier version of this
docstring listed results for a detector version that had never been executed, and the first real run
of it contradicted the record. The durable claim is therefore the FIXTURE SUITE, not prose:

    python3 src_utils/test_trapped_prose.py

That suite carries all six historical defects plus three negatives, it runs in the repository rather
than in a scratch tree that gets swept, and check.sh runs it BEFORE this checker so a clean document
is not reported as evidence when the checker itself is broken.

Runs executed against THIS version, 2026-07-27:
  fixtures (src_utils/test_trapped_prose.py)     -> 9/9 pass
  repaired tree (this repository)                -> 0 suspects
  the true pre-fix tree, reconstructed by
  `git archive 70d3888d` into a scratch dir      -> exactly 3 suspects:
       2_fundamentals.tex:366, 6_conclusion.tex:105, apx_b_errata.tex:188
Reconstructing the defect state from the commit is the reproducible check; a /tmp copy is not.

Exit 1 if any suspect is found, so this can gate a build.
