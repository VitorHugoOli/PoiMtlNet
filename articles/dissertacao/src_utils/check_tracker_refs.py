"""check_tracker_refs.py -- every live PENDENCIAS section citation must resolve.

WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-07-29 PENDENCIAS.md was renumbered (2.3-2.7 -> 2.4-2.8) to insert a new
item. Four source comments cited "PENDENCIAS 2.2" for the static-scope section. Three were
repointed; the fourth -- apx_b_static_scope.tex's own header, the file the citation is ABOUT -- was
missed, and the commit message claimed all four had been done. The grep that found four was run,
its output was read, and the fix list was written with three entries.

Nothing caught it, because a stale section number is not a LaTeX error, not an undefined reference,
and not a broken link. It renders fine and points somewhere wrong. That is the same silent class as
AGENT_HANDOFF §2.6 (records that drift from the thing they describe): the citation and its target
drift apart and only a reader who follows the pointer notices.

WHAT IT CHECKS. Every `PENDENCIAS <n>.<m>` citation in the live tree resolves to a heading that
exists in PENDENCIAS.md. A citation may be deliberately historical -- the tracker is rewritten every
round and a quote can outlive its coordinate -- so a citation is EXEMPT when its own text says so,
by carrying "was <n>.<m>" or naming the date of the tracker it refers to. That keeps the gate from
punishing an honest historical reference while still catching a silently orphaned one.

DELIBERATELY NOT CHECKED: citations inside dated audit records (_round*/, _review_v*/, _archive/,
_gates/, _specialists*/). Those describe a tracker as it stood and must not be rewritten.

    THE DEFECT, found by the author on 2026-07-30 and then measured across all 63 revisions of the
    tracker: 91 distinct items have existed by title; 30 are live; 61 left. Nineteen went to
    _archive/PENDENCIAS_RESOLVIDOS.md as intended. Of the rest, most were retitles of an item that is
    still live or archived (the sign-off marker item alone was retitled six times as its count changed,
    27 -> 31 -> 32 -> 46 -> 53 -> 55). Seven survived that filter as candidate losses, and the first
    version of this docstring said "TWO were real losses" -- a count taken before two of the seven had
    been measured at all. Corrected after review. All seven, each probed:

      * Ch.4 ITALICS -- LOST. 153 \emph of ordinary English, title said "e uma decisao sua", gone at
        1ef83867 with no decision and no archive entry. Restored as 2.20.
      * REV-024, bibliography font -- CLOSED BUT UNARCHIVED. Commit 9e2b5157, struck through.
        Re-verified (no \footnotesize wrapper in any live root file) and moved to the archive.
      * The ADVISOR'S TERMINOLOGY point -- LOST, and I first counted it accounted WITHOUT PROBING IT.
        Measured: the hole it named (persona 03's report never citing the MobiWac glossary) is closed --
        re-run 28/07, zero banned repo codenames in live Ch.5 prose, the two "frozen" hits are
        "frozen weights", a documented exception. Restored as 2.21; it stays open only for the
        author's own marked-up terms, which I do not have.
      * CATEGORY DETERMINISM in five states -- ACCOUNTED, and my probe looked in the wrong file. It is
        the content of apx_b_static_scope.tex and renders on p.11 of main_extra.pdf: "between 284 and
        365 distinct values per state". A grep of the archive returned 0 and I read that as a loss.
      * The CHECKER-COVERAGE item -> live as 2.10. Ch.4 FIGURE LABELS -> LEFT_OUT LO-6.
        STATIC-TASK SCOPE (REV-002) -> live as 2.4.

    Item 2.2 was another of the same class, found the same day by the author reading the file.

    WHY NO GATE SAW IT. check_tracker_refs verified that citations RESOLVE and nesting_problems() that
    items sit under their own section. Neither asks whether an item that USED to exist still exists
    somewhere. A deletion leaves nothing to check -- which is exactly why it needs a check that reads
    history rather than the current file.

    This function is deliberately CHEAP and NARROW: it compares the live tracker against the archive
    for items whose heading survives in git HEAD~N only. Running the full 63-revision sweep on every
    `make check` would be the work-inside-work mistake that made this suite take 265 seconds, so the
    deep sweep stays a manual procedure, documented in PENDENCIAS 2.21.
