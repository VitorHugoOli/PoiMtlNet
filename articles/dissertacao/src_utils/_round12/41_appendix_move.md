# 41_appendix_move.md -- A.1, C.3 and E moved out of the defense volume into the extra material

Round 12, 2026-08-03. Baseline commit `8f17f294`. Wall-clock budget 40 minutes.

## The author's instruction, verbatim

> "Vamos remover o appendix A.1, C.3, E, madem esses para o conteudo extra"
> "APENDICES -- remover A.1, C.3 e E, mandando esse conteudo para o material extra."

The file-to-letter mapping was resolved and confirmed with him before this round and is written up in
`src_utils/_round12/40_appendix_letters.md`. I did not re-derive it. I DID verify it still held, by
reading the defense build's own `.aux` label table at baseline, before touching anything (command and
output below). His ruling on the one concern raised about C.3 -- move all three as instructed,
preserve that text intact -- is implemented and not re-litigated here.

## The mapping verified before the move (not predicted from file names)

From `src/`, at baseline:

    grep -rh "newlabel{apx" build/main-aux/ | sort

    \newlabel{apx:ai}{{B}{99}{AI-Use Disclosure}{appendix.B}{}}
    \newlabel{apx:contributions:platform}{{A.1}{96}{The experimental platform}{section.A.1}{}}
    \newlabel{apx:contributions:repro}{{A.2}{96}{Reproducing the reported numbers}{section.A.2}{}}
    \newlabel{apx:contributions}{{A}{96}{Other Scientific Contributions}{appendix.A}{}}
    \newlabel{apx:cosine}{{D}{103}{Why the Two Tasks Do Not Compete on the Shared Trunk}{appendix.D}{}}
    \newlabel{apx:cosine:setup}{{D.1}{103}{What was measured, and on what unit}{section.D.1}{}}
    \newlabel{apx:ethics}{{C}{100}{Data Ethics and Governance}{appendix.C}{}}
    \newlabel{apx:hgi-tuning}{{E}{108}{Adaptation of the HGI Baseline}{appendix.E}{}}

So A.1 = `apx_a_contributions.tex` §"The experimental platform"; C.3 = the third section of
`apx_e_ethics.tex`, "The human-subjects question" (the `.aux` carries no per-section labels for the
ethics sections, so C.3 is fixed by ordinal within Appendix C, whose letter the table above does
give); E = `apx_g_hgi_tuning.tex`. The mapping held. Note one detail the earlier write-up does not
state and that the aux does: the defense volume's Appendix D title prints as "Why the Two Tasks Do
Not Compete on the Shared Trunk", not "Why the Two Tasks Do Not Conflict"; 40_appendix_letters.md
gives the older title. That difference does not affect any of the three moves.

## The live text before my edit

`src/chapters/apx_a_contributions.tex`, lines 26-27 and the opening of the moved prose, read live
immediately before editing:

    26 \section{The experimental platform}
    27 \label{apx:contributions:platform}
    ...
    32 Beyond the three studies of this collection, this research produced a reusable software
    33 platform that supported the experiments of Chapters~\ref{ch:cbic}
    34 and~\ref{ch:mobiwac} and is released with the code.
    ...
    94 the evidence protocol the frame follows.
    95
    96 \section{Reproducing the reported numbers}

`src/chapters/apx_e_ethics.tex`, lines 83-98 (98 was the last line of prose, file length 99):

    83 \section{The human-subjects question}
    84
    85 The studies are a secondary analysis of two collections that were already public before
    86 the work began, and no participant was recruited, contacted, or observed by the author.
    87 On that basis the author's position is that review by a research ethics committee was
    88 not required. This appendix records that position and its basis. It records no approval
    89 and no exemption, because none was sought and none is claimed.
    90
    91 A comparable dissertation defended in this program in 2024, on location-based social
    92 network data and under the same advisor \cite{santos2024urban}, was consulted on the point.
    ... (through :98 "should then name it.")

`src/content.tex`, the defense appendix block:

    364     \begin{apendicesenv}
    365         \partapendices
    366         \include{chapters/apx_a_contributions}
    367         \include{chapters/apx_c_ai_disclosure}
    368         \include{chapters/apx_e_ethics}
    373         \include{chapters/apx_f_cosine}
    374         \include{chapters/apx_g_hgi_tuning}
    375     \end{apendicesenv}

`src/main_extra.tex`, the extra-volume appendix block (:274-287) included `apx_b_errata` under
`\setcounter{chapter}{1}` and `apx_d_ceiling` under `\setcounter{chapter}{3}`, and its opening
statement said "This volume holds two appendices".

## What I changed, and where

**New files (the moved content, verbatim).**

- `src/chapters/apx_extra_platform.tex` (NEW). Carries the former A.1 text, byte-for-byte from
  `apx_a_contributions.tex`:20-95 at baseline, including the `[NEEDS SIGN-OFF]` and provenance
  comments that annotated it. TWO changes to that text and no others: `\section{The experimental
  platform}` becomes `\chapter{The Experimental Platform}` (a section cannot stand alone as an
  appendix), and the title capitalization follows this volume's chapter-title convention.
  `\label{apx:contributions:platform}` is unchanged, so any record naming that label still resolves.
  A round-12 note marks the four inherited lines that describe the old Appendix A structure as
  history, since that structure has since changed.
- `src/chapters/apx_extra_human_subjects.tex` (NEW). Carries the former C.3 text verbatim from
  `apx_e_ethics.tex`:83-98. Same two changes (`\section` -> `\chapter`, title capitalization) and no
  others; a `\label{apx:human-subjects}` was added because a chapter in this volume needs one.
  Its header records the concern raised and the author's ruling, and carries forward the
  `[NEEDS SIGN-OFF]` that Appendix C of the defense volume held over this prose.
- `src/chapters/apx_g_hgi_tuning.tex` is **not modified at all**. E moved as a unit: only its
  `\include` site changed volumes. Its `% !TeX root = ../main.tex` directive is left as it stands,
  matching `apx_b_errata.tex` and `apx_d_ceiling.tex`, which carry the same directive while living in
  the extra volume; `check_tex_root` passes on all 57 files.

**Defense volume (content removed, pointers checked).**

- `src/chapters/apx_a_contributions.tex`: lines 20-95 replaced by a 14-line removal note
  (file:19-32 now). The note carries the command that measured the reference sites and the
  consequence the author may want to rule on.
- `src/chapters/apx_e_ethics.tex`: lines 83-98 replaced by a 13-line removal note (file:82-94 now).
- `src/content.tex`: `\include{chapters/apx_g_hgi_tuning}` removed from the `apendicesenv` block,
  replaced by a 10-line note (:373-382) recording the instruction, the new home, that E was last so
  no letter shifts, and the measured absence of `\ref` sites.

**Extra volume (content added, reader-facing prose updated).**

- `src/main_extra.tex`: three `\include` lines added after `apx_d_ceiling`, at `\setcounter{chapter}`
  4, 5 and 6, so the new appendices print E, F, G (:280-301). Five prose edits to the opening
  statement, because it made four reader-facing claims that the move falsified: "two appendices" ->
  "five appendices"; one sentence each added describing the three arrivals; "Both were part of the
  main document until July of 2026" -> "The first two were...", plus a new paragraph for the three
  that left in August; a sentence added to the auditability paragraph; and the conventions paragraph
  rewritten to say that B and D keep their dissertation letters while E, F and G are letters of this
  volume alone, with "its own two appendices" -> "its own five appendices".

**One gate probe repaired (not weakened).** See the next section.

## The dangling-reference sweep

From `src/`, comments stripped per GUARDRAILS §4b V4, over `chapters/`, `tables/` and the four entry
files:

    for f in $(grep -rl "apx:contributions\|apx:ethics\|apx:hgi-tuning" chapters tables *.tex); do
      out=$(grep -v '^[[:space:]]*%' "$f" | grep -n "apx:contributions\|apx:ethics\|apx:hgi-tuning")
      [ -n "$out" ] && { echo "--- $f"; echo "$out"; }
    done

Result: **only the `\label` declarations themselves.** Not one `\ref`, `\autoref` or `\cref` targeted
any of the three labels, in either volume, before the move. `apx:ethics` was already known to be
referenced nowhere (`src_utils/_round6/ANCHORS.md`:101). Prose that names the material by letter or
title was swept separately (`Appendix~[A-F]`, "experimental platform", "human-subjects", "HGI
Baseline", "cross-region"): every "Appendix B/D" in chapter prose already reads "of
\extravolume", and no chapter names A.1, C.3 or E. So no sentence in the defense volume stopped
resolving, and nothing needed repointing.

The rendered check is the one that counts, and it is in the next section: **zero `??` in all four
PDFs.**

`chapters/2_fundamentals.tex` **is another agent's file and I did not touch it.** For the record, my
sweep found NO `\ref{apx:hgi-tuning}` there: the only two occurrences of that string in the file are
`%` comments (`:264` and `:289`), one of which quotes the author's own instruction. So that agent's
item 3 is about prose that names the sweep, not about a dangling reference, and my removal of the
appendix does not create one in his file.

## The gate that went red, and why the fix is a repair rather than a weakening

`make check` returned **rc=2** on the first post-edit run. One gate failed:
`check_verify_list` -> `VERIFY_LIST.md` item 6, "output does not contain 'repair_in_prose: True'".

That probe hard-codes the file it reads:

    t = live_text(Path('src/chapters/apx_a_contributions.tex'))

and the sentence it looks for ("stratified its folds by sample rather than by user") is inside the
A.1 text I moved. The sentence did not change one character; its address did. Measured, from
`articles/dissertacao/`:

    python3 -c "
    import sys; sys.path.insert(0,'src_utils')
    from pathlib import Path
    from check_audit_claims import live_text
    hits=[]; retired=[]
    for p in sorted(Path('src').rglob('*.tex')):
        if 'build' in p.parts: continue
        t=live_text(p)
        if 'stratified its folds by sample rather than by user' in t: hits.append(str(p))
        if 'without identifying the split axis' in t: retired.append(str(p))
    print('repair sites:',hits); print('retired sites:',retired)"

    repair sites: ['src/chapters/apx_extra_platform.tex']
    retired sites: []

Both EXPECT lines are therefore still TRUE of the tree; the instrument was measuring the address.
The probe's own history says it had already been repointed once for the same reason (2026-08-02, when
the author moved this clause out of Chapter 2 into Appendix A), so I widened it instead of repointing
it a second time: it now reads every live `.tex` under `src/` rather than one named file. **Neither
EXPECT line changed and neither assertion is relaxed** -- so the retired clause is caught wherever it
reappears and the repair

is found wherever the author puts it. The comment above it records the measurement and the reason.

Instrument validated before trusting it (GUARDRAILS §4b V3), positive and negative control in one
run:

    positive_control (a sentence known live): True
    negative_control (a string that cannot be live): False
    retired_clause_in_prose: False

## The letters that remain, read from the build after the edit

Defense volume, from `src/`, `grep -rh "newlabel{apx" build/main-aux/ | sort`:

    \newlabel{apx:contributions}{{A}{95}{Other Scientific Contributions}{appendix.A}{}}
    \newlabel{apx:contributions:repro}{{A.1}{95}{Reproducing the reported numbers}{section.A.1}{}}
    \newlabel{apx:ai}{{B}{97}{AI-Use Disclosure}{appendix.B}{}}
    \newlabel{apx:ethics}{{C}{98}{Data Ethics and Governance}{appendix.C}{}}
    \newlabel{apx:cosine}{{D}{100}{Why the Two Tasks Do Not Compete on the Shared Trunk}{appendix.D}{}}
    \newlabel{apx:cosine:setup}{{D.1}{100}{What was measured, and on what unit}{section.D.1}{}}
    \newlabel{apx:cosine:result}{{D.2}{101}{The result}{section.D.2}{}}
    \newlabel{apx:cosine:mechanism}{{D.3}{103}{What orthogonality explains}{section.D.3}{}}
    \newlabel{apx:cosine:extension}{{D.4}{103}{How far this extends, and how far it does not}{section.D.4}{}}

**Confirmed: A, B, C, D unchanged. E is gone and no letter shifted**, as predicted for a last
appendix, and now measured rather than predicted. One subsection number DID shift, inside Appendix A:
"Reproducing the reported numbers" was A.2 and is now **A.1**, because it is the only section left.
Appendix C keeps C.1 and C.2 (both render: "Where the data came from", "Real people, and how the
traces are handled" each appear twice in the PDF, body plus table of contents) and no longer has a
C.3.

`apx_f_cosine.tex`'s own self-citation: the only internal cross-reference in that file is
`Section~\ref{apx:cosine:mechanism}`, which renders as **"Section D.3"** (count 1 in the PDF text
layer), and the appendix's four subsection numbers still print D.1 through D.4 in the table of
contents and in the body. Note for the record: 40_appendix_letters.md describes that file as citing
"§D.1"; the live file cites D.3. Either way the letter D and the D.n sequence are intact.

A stale `.aux` caveat, stated rather than hidden: `build/main-aux/chapters/apx_g_hgi_tuning.aux` is a
LEFTOVER file from the pre-edit build (mtime 10:50, all other chapter aux files 10:57) and still
contains `\newlabel{apx:hgi-tuning}{{E}...}`. It is not read by `main.aux` and `\ref` cannot reach
it. `make check` (which includes `check_extra_xrefs`, the gate that compares volumes) is green with
it present. It disappears on `make clean`, which I did not run because it would force full rebuilds
in a tree other agents are working in.

Extra volume, `grep -rh "newlabel{apx" build/main_extra-aux/ | sort`:

    \newlabel{apx:errata}{{B}{6}...}          (B.1-B.6 at 6-14)
    \newlabel{apx:ceiling}{{D}{20}...}
    \newlabel{apx:contributions:platform}{{E}{23}{The Experimental Platform}{appendix.E}{}}
    \newlabel{apx:human-subjects}{{F}{24}{The Human-Subjects Question}{appendix.F}{}}
    \newlabel{apx:hgi-tuning}{{G}{25}{Adaptation of the HGI Baseline}{appendix.G}{}}

B and D keep their frozen letters. The three arrivals take E, F, G.

## Verification in the rendered PDF, both directions

`pypdfium2` text layer, whitespace collapsed and the Unicode dash range normalized to ASCII, over all
four builds. Six probes: the heading and one prose string from each moved piece.

| build | pp | `??` | A.1 heading | A.1 prose | C.3 heading | C.3 prose | E heading | E prose |
|---|--:|--:|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| defense    | 104 | 0 | absent | absent | absent | absent | absent | absent |
| academico  | 101 | 0 | absent | absent | absent | absent | absent | absent |
| ppgc       | 105 | 0 | absent | absent | absent | absent | absent | absent |
| extra      |  26 | 0 | PRESENT | PRESENT | PRESENT | PRESENT | PRESENT | PRESENT |

Strings used: "The Experimental Platform"; "registry-driven experimental framework"; "Human-Subjects
Question"; "It records no approval and no exemption, because none was sought and none is claimed";
"Adaptation of the HGI Baseline"; "The later studies therefore use 0.7". Both directions hold in
every volume, and the literal `??` count is **zero in all four PDFs**. `APPENDIX E` appears zero
times in the defense PDF; `APPENDIX A/B/C/D` appear 3/2/3/6 times (body plus contents plus, for D,
the in-prose "Appendix~D of the supplementary volume" pointers).

## The six exit codes required by rule 6

Each run separately, one command per invocation, from
`/Users/vitor/Desktop/mestrado/ingred/articles/dissertacao/src`, exit code read directly from `$?`
and not through a pipe:

| command | rc | what it printed |
|---|--:|---|
| `make defense`   | **0** | `pages=104 tex_errors=0` |
| `make academico` | **0** | `pages=101 tex_errors=0` |
| `make ppgc`      | **0** | `pages=105 tex_errors=0` |
| `make extra`     | **0** | `pages=26 tex_errors=0` |
| `make check`     | **2** | one gate red, and it is NOT mine: see below |
| `make selftest`  | **0** | `every required checker fires on its defect and stays silent on the clean fixture` |

`make check` was run twice. The FIRST run, rc=2, was red on `check_verify_list` (my move, repaired as
documented above) and on `check_trapped_prose`. The SECOND run, after the probe repair, is rc=2 with
`check_verify_list` green (`21 documented command(s) executed; 13 carried a machine-checkable
expectation; 0 failed`) and **one gate still red**:

    TRAPPED PROSE 2_fundamentals.tex:986
      comment tail: Liu (CAGrad, FAMO) in this same paragraph.

**That failure is not mine and not in a file my item names.** It is in
`chapters/2_fundamentals.tex`, which another agent is editing right now and which I am forbidden to
touch. It postdates the baseline: `git show 8f17f294:./src/chapters/2_fundamentals.tex | grep -c "in
this same paragraph"` returns **0**, and that file currently carries 171 insertions and 110 deletions
of uncommitted change from the other track. The 24 other gates are green, including
`check_extra_xrefs` (the cross-volume gate this move could plausibly have broken),
`check_tex_root` (57 files), `check_trapped_prose`'s own scope over the supplementary render
(it examined my two new files by name: `apx_extra_human_subjects`, `apx_extra_platform`), and the
page-count gate.

I did not touch that gate, that file, or that finding. **`make check` is rc=2 in the tree I am
handing over, and the cause is a fundamentals-chapter comment that another agent owns.** Stating it
as red rather than as "green except" per GUARDRAILS §4b V11.

## Page counts and the sync

| build | before (baseline `8f17f294`) | after |
|---|--:|--:|
| defense   | 108 | **104** |
| academico | 105 | **101** |
| ppgc      | 109 | **105** |
| extra     |  22 |  **26** |

Four pages left each dissertation volume and four arrived in the supplementary volume.

**I did NOT need to run `--write`.** `python3 ../src_utils/sync_page_counts.py` returned rc=0 with
"all recorded page counts agree with the build" on the first post-edit run, and the page-count gate
inside `make check` was green. I ran `--write` anyway, as the brief anticipates, and it was a no-op:
it printed the same "all recorded page counts agree with the build" and changed no file (confirmed in
`git diff --stat`, where no page-count record appears among the changed files). The reason the gate
never went red is that the recorded counts it compares against had already been synced by whichever
track last edited them; the numbers 108/105/109 in my brief were the baseline commit's, and the
tree's live records had moved on before I arrived.

One stale page-count string exists and is not mine to fix: `src_utils/PENDENCIAS.md`:129 reads
"Builds 106/103/107/22 pp" inside a dated `(C) Status` paragraph. It was already stale at baseline
(the baseline was 108/105/109) and no gate reads it. Flagged, not edited.

## Probe added

None. I added no gate. One EXISTING probe was repaired to survive the move
(`src_utils/_round6/VERIFY_LIST.md` item 6, widened from one hard-coded path to every live `.tex`),
with both EXPECT lines unchanged, the measurement recorded inline, and the instrument validated
against a positive and a negative control before I trusted it.

## Flags for the author

1. **Appendix A now carries one section under a title written for two.** "Other Scientific
   Contributions" opens straight into "A.1 Reproducing the reported numbers". Retitling the appendix,
   or dissolving the lone heading into an unsectioned statement (as the file header records was the
   shape before round 6), is a choice I did not make for you. The `\label{apx:contributions:repro}`
   number changed from A.2 to A.1 as a consequence; nothing references it.
2. **Appendix C's opening paragraph still promises "what remains unsettled".** With C.3 gone, that
   clause resolves against the outstanding Foursquare product-terms check at the end of C.1, which is
   a fair reading, but you may want the sentence tightened.
3. **The C.3 position is now readable only in the supplementary volume.** That is your ruling and it
   is implemented with the text intact. A committee question about ethics review is answered by a
   document that is not the defense volume.
4. **`apx_g_hgi_tuning.tex` keeps `% !TeX root = ../main.tex`** while living in the extra volume,
   matching the two appendices already there. If you want editor builds of those files to open the
   supplementary volume, that is a three-file change and a separate decision.
5. **Renaming the three files** to `apx_e_*`, `apx_f_*`, `apx_g_*` of the extra volume would make the
   prefixes match the new letters. I did not, for the reason `content.tex` already records: the
   letter comes from the counter, not the file name, and renaming touches references for no rendered
   difference.

## Sources opened this session

Everything below is a file in this repository; no external source was needed for this item, and no
citation was added, removed, or altered by it.

- `AGENT_GUARDRAILS.md` §0-§4b (read 1-240). §4b V1 (a number carries its command), V2 (re-read the
  output), V3 (validate the instrument), V4 (strip comments before grepping), V11 (a verification
  line only after the last edit) are the rules this report is written under.
- `WRITING_LAW.md` §4 (AI-tell law, banned vocabulary, burstiness, idiom rule) -- applied to the five
  prose edits in `main_extra.tex`.
- `src_utils/_round12/40_appendix_letters.md` -- the confirmed mapping, and the record of the concern
  raised about C.3 and the author's ruling on it.
- `src/main_extra.tex`, `src/content.tex`, `src/chapters/apx_a_contributions.tex`,
  `src/chapters/apx_e_ethics.tex`, `src/chapters/apx_g_hgi_tuning.tex`,
  `src/chapters/apx_f_cosine.tex` -- the live text, read immediately before each edit.
- `src_utils/check_extra_xrefs.py` (docstring, the three failure directions),
  `src_utils/check_tex_root.py`, `src_utils/check_comment_hygiene.py` (SCOPE), `src/Makefile`
  (targets), `src_utils/sync_page_counts.py`, `src_utils/_round6/VERIFY_LIST.md` item 6.
- `build/main-aux/**/*.aux` and `build/main_extra-aux/**/*.aux` -- the letter tables, before and
  after.
- `build/main.pdf`, `build/main_academico.pdf`, `build/main_ppgc.pdf`, `build/main_extra.pdf` -- the
  text layer, both directions.

## UNFINISHED

- **`make check` is rc=2 in the tree I hand over.** The one red gate is `check_trapped_prose` on
  `chapters/2_fundamentals.tex`:986, a file my item forbids me to touch and which another agent is
  editing this round. It postdates baseline `8f17f294` (that commit's copy of the file contains the
  string zero times). It must go green before this round is committed, and the fix belongs to the
  fundamentals track. Nothing about my move caused it and nothing about my move depends on it.
- The five author decisions listed under "Flags for the author" are open by design, not incomplete
  work: each is a judgment reserved to him.
- `src_utils/PENDENCIAS.md`:129 carries a stale build-status string ("106/103/107/22 pp"). Stale
  before I arrived, ungated, not my file, not edited.
- No commit was made. The working tree carries this move alongside the other tracks' uncommitted
  changes.
