# 53 — Comparative study: option (a) keep tasks-first versus option (b) invert §2.1/§2.2

<!-- Round 12, 2026-08-03. AUTHORIZED SCOPE: this ONE markdown file. Nothing here is applied; the
     author has SUSPENDED his earlier authorization of the inversion and decides after reading this.
     No .tex, GLOSSARY.md, NORTH_STAR.md, PENDENCIAS.md, or check_audit_claims.py was edited.
     Every repository-history claim below carries the command that produced it, run this session.
     A parallel agent shares this checkout; every file quoted was re-read from disk this session. -->

The question, as the author set it: which option keeps the best narrative AND fixes the definition
problems. Both options remove the forward dependency (Definition 2.3 at
`src/chapters/2_fundamentals.tex:116-124` consumes $\mathbf{e}_p$, defined at `:434-437`), so the
decision is not "does it work" but "which leaves the cleaner structure, at what narrative cost".
Narrative is the primary criterion. [VERIFY: the criterion sentence "mantem a MELHOR NARRATIVA e
corrige os problemas de definicao" was received in the task brief; a grep for it across the
repository's markdown returned zero hits, so it is quoted from the brief, not from a file. The
nearest on-disk statement is the author's caution, "a narrativa tem que esta acima desse problema,
temos que ter muito cuidade", `fundamentals/DEFINITIONS.md:610-611`.]

**Verdict in one line: keep the order (option a), because the two narrative trades that worried the
author are real, permanent, and both on option (b)'s side of the ledger, while every narrative cost
of option (a) is local to one subsubsection and repairable with prose he must sign off anyway. This
is a recommendation; the decision is his.**

---

## 0. The state of the tree, verified this session

- The live chapter has **twelve** numbered definitions
  (`grep -n 'begin{definition}' src/chapters/2_fundamentals.tex`: lines 71, 80, 116, 126, 133, 167,
  434, 461, 684, 690, 699, 893). The thirteen-definition redesign (AD-1, "Vamos de treze",
  `fundamentals/DEFINITIONS.md:587`) is NOT applied: `grep -n 'rho' src/chapters/2_fundamentals.tex`
  returns three hits, all substrings of "neighborhood"/"node2vec" (lines 243, 603, 1048); the symbol
  $\rho$ appears nowhere in the chapter.
- The GLOSSARY rows the redesign requires are already landed: $\rho$ at `GLOSSARY.md:45` and $d$ at
  `GLOSSARY.md:46` (recorded in `src_utils/PENDENCIAS.md:1668-1701`, §6.25 item 2). This is a paid
  cost that neither option has to pay again.
- The suspension is on the record: `src_utils/PENDENCIAS.md:1705-1707` ("A sua suspensao esta
  respeitada: nada de inverter, nada de editar o `NORTH_STAR.md:73-80`, e o plano de oito passos do
  `_round12/49` continua parado").
- The chapter file has grown since `_round12/49` validated it: 49 read 1521 lines; today
  `wc -l src/chapters/2_fundamentals.tex` gives **1527**. The §2.1/§2.2 definition lines are
  unchanged (71-461 match 49's table); the four §2.3 definitions shifted by about six lines (684,
  690, 699, 893 against 49's 678, 684, 693, 887). Three commits touched the chapter on 2026-08-03
  after 49 was written (`git log -- articles/dissertacao/src/chapters/2_fundamentals.tex`, run from
  the repo root: `de8a1bef`, `0f231856`, `8f17f294`). Consequence for either option: coordinates are
  re-derived at application; no validation from 49 is carried on line numbers alone.

## 1. What each option is

**Option (a), keep the order.** Sections stay 2.1 tasks, 2.2 representations. The two
representation definitions (`def:fund:placelevel`, `:434-437`; `def:fund:checkinlevel`, `:461-465`)
and the new representation map $\rho$ move UP into §2.1, into a new subsubsection between
"Check-ins and histories" (`:66`) and "The three experimental tasks" (`:111`). This is the
eight-step plan of `_round12/49_definitions_validation_and_plan.md` Part B.

**Option (b), invert.** §2.2 (representations) becomes the first section, carrying the notation
prose (`:68-70`), Definitions 2.1/2.2 (check-in `:71-78`, history `:80-86`), the two representation
definitions, and $\rho$; the tasks section follows, defining "as tarefas que podemos treinar com
essas representacoes" (the author's proposal, verbatim at `fundamentals/DEFINITIONS.md:607-609`).
Studied in `_round12/52_inversion_study.md`, which recommended it with five conditions.

Under both options the thirteen-definition design of `fundamentals/DEFINITIONS.md` §5 is what
lands, with 49's corrections F-1 (Chapter 5's two-stream instantiation), F-2 (scope the
factorization remark to the sequential tasks), F-3 ("hold the task definitions fixed"), and F-4
(padding is a Chapters-3-and-4 device) applied to the remark text. Those four fixes are
order-independent.

## 2. The narrative comparison (the primary criterion)

### 2.1 The reader this chapter is for

Chapter 2 is the thin shared-background chapter of a coletanea (`NORTH_STAR.md:73`, "[thin;
de-duplicates background across the papers]"). Its reader is a banca on a first pass, arriving from
Chapter 1 (which already names the two tasks and the arc) and heading into three paper chapters.
All three papers are problem-first: MobiWac's problem statement precedes its method ("Given a
user's time-ordered check-in history, we predict two properties of the next visit",
`src/chapters/5_mobiwac/03_problem.tex:12`), and the chapter order inside `3_cbic.tex:87-91`,
`4_courb.tex:64-68`, `5_mobiwac.tex:46-53` runs intro/related/problem-or-method in every case, with
the problem or task statement ahead of the solution machinery. The review gates make the first-pass
reader the governing persona: G3 does not pass on lint alone, and "any sentence or paragraph whose
intended meaning or logical connection requires a second reading returns to editing"
(`AGENT_GUARDRAILS.md` §5).

### 2.2 Option (a) at chapter scale and at section scale

At chapter scale (a) preserves everything the current shape does well: the chapter opens on the
domain (LBSNs, check-ins, the 93 percent bound, `:27-38`), states the targets, then develops the
machinery. The reader rehearses, once, the reading pattern the three papers will demand three
times. The chapter map (`NORTH_STAR.md:73-80`) is untouched, the introduction's organization bullet
(`src/chapters/1_introduction.tex:258-260`) stays true, and the §2.5 synthesis ("The argument
begins with the targets", `:1431`) keeps mirroring the chapter's physical order.

At section scale (a) has a real cost that `_round12/52` never priced, because pricing (a) was not
its job. A section titled "Point-of-interest prediction tasks" comes to host two representation
definitions and a map. Three specific losses for a reader:

1. **Title fidelity.** The section does something its title does not promise. The §2.1 opening
   sentence ("This section defines the prediction targets before reviewing the methods used for
   them", `:27-28`) becomes half-true; 49's own A.1 note flags this and routes it to the author
   (AD-4).
2. **Motivation displacement.** The limitation paragraph that gives the place embedding its stakes
   ("a weekday morning and a Saturday night at the same place have identical inputs at the
   representation level", `:439-441`) STAYS in §2.2 under 49's step 4. The moved definitions are
   met cold, roughly 300 lines before the story that explains why anyone should care about the
   difference between them. This is the current defect in rhetorical mirror image: today the symbol
   precedes its definition; under (a) the definition precedes its motivation.
3. **The pivot spent early.** The chapter's own comment layer calls the two representations "the
   pivot of the whole argument" (`:447-449`, comment layer, cited as a comment and not as prose).
   Under (a) that pivot is introduced as notation plumbing inside a section about something else,
   and §2.2's climactic move (place-level to check-in-level) recalls rather than states its formal
   objects.

All three losses are local, and all three are repairable with prose the author must approve anyway:
a one-sentence lead-in in the new subsubsection stating WHY the representations are defined here
(the static task reads one), an adjusted §2.1 opening sentence, and a head name he chooses (AD-4).
None of them touches the chapter map, the bridges, the synthesis, or any file outside the chapter.

### 2.3 Option (b) at chapter scale and at section scale

At section scale (b) is the cleaner arrangement, and this should be said without hedging: each
definition sits in the section titled for it, the dependency is removed at the root rather than
patched, nothing moves into a foreign section, and AD-4's subsubsection is dropped, exactly as the
author anticipated ("maybe with this inversion we even need this new section", pinned by probe
`R12-ad4cond`, `src_utils/check_audit_claims.py:617-625`).

At chapter scale (b) carries the two trades 52 itself marked as irreparable and authorial, and the
author suspended his authorization over precisely these:

1. **Divergence from the papers' shape.** The banca reads a method-first fundamentals chapter and
   then three problem-first papers. The divergence is permanent and must be owned; no rewrite
   removes it.
2. **The solution space before the problem.** §2.2's whole argument is teleological ("This section
   traces the representations used in the dissertation and explains why the final study moves from
   a place embedding to a check-in-level representation", `:212-213`). The WHY is task-driven: the
   static-vector limitation is only a defect relative to a target that varies across visits to one
   place. Under (b) the stakes are carried by an informal two-sentence anchor in a rewritten
   chapter opening, and seven live sites inside §2.2 (`:253`, `:272`, `:292`, `:300`, `:484-485`,
   `:563-564`, `src/tables/frame/lineage.tex:34`, all re-verified as live prose this session) use
   task vocabulary that no definition yet precedes.

Beyond the two trades, (b)'s repair surface is wider: the chapter opening (`:14-20`) and the §2.1
opening (`:27-28`, which becomes FALSE, not stale), the §2.5 enumeration (`:1415`), the
introduction bullet (`1_introduction.tex:258-260`), a rewritten bridge at `:194-197` plus a new
reverse bridge, the migration of the notation prose and Definitions 2.1/2.2, the migration or cold
opening of the §2.1 entry material (`:27-38`), the `NORTH_STAR.md:73-80` map edit (his hand), and
the re-anchoring of trackers keyed to current numbering (PENDENCIAS §4 items 16-22 at
`src_utils/PENDENCIAS.md:1809-1827`; `src_utils/NEEDS_SIGN_OFF.md:169`; `NORTH_STAR.md:203-208`;
`storyline/README.md:21`).

### 2.4 The mirror argument, head-on

Both orders are faithful mirrors of the thesis. Tasks-first mirrors the DESIGN of the argument:
fix the reference point, then vary the lever. Representations-first mirrors its ANSWER: the lever
is what mattered. The GLOSSARY's own $\rho$ row states the design mirror as the reason the claim is
expressible at all: "The three studies hold the task definitions fixed and vary $\rho$, which is
what makes the dissertation's central claim expressible" (`GLOSSARY.md:45`).

The tie-breaker is not the thesis; it is the reader. Two observations decide it for me:

1. **The answer-mirror pays only a reader who already holds the answer.** The elegance of
   "representations first, because representations turned out to dominate" is legible to a
   re-reader, or to the author, who knows the arc. A first-pass banca member does not yet hold the
   thesis as a conviction; for that reader the tasks are the frame that makes every later
   definition intelligible, and the limitation sentence lands hardest when the reader already knows
   the target varies across visits at one place. The design-mirror is a scaffold for a first
   reading; the answer-mirror is a reward for a second. The project's own gate rule (G3
   first-read comprehension) makes the first reading the one that governs.
2. **The invariant is what the three papers share; the fundamentals chapter is where the reader
   acquires the shared frame.** Chapter 2 exists to make three differently shaped papers read as
   one document. What is constant across them is the task definitions; what changes is $\rho$. A
   background chapter ordered invariant-first hands the reader the fixed frame once and lets each
   paper chapter vary the lever against it. Ordered answer-first, the chapter asks the reader to
   hold representations in suspension until told what they predict.

So: the design-mirror (tasks-first) serves a READER of this specific document better; the
answer-mirror serves the ARGUMENT as an object of contemplation. A dissertation's fundamentals
chapter is written for the former. This is a judgment, and I mark it as one; but it is the judgment
the criterion asks for, and it is the opposite of the resolution 52 reached.

## 3. The definitional comparison

Both options fix the one forward edge; neither introduces a new one. The differences:

| dimension | option (a) | option (b) |
|---|---|---|
| dependency | acyclic; order D1-D13 realizes the graph (49 A.1, graph rebuilt symbol by symbol) | acyclic; representations-first is the topological order of the symbol graph itself, PROVIDED notation + D1/D2 migrate with it (52 §3 correction 3) |
| notation block | stays where it is (`:68-70`); binds $c_p$/$r_p$ in place (49 steps 1-2) | migrates to the leading section, or a new pre-section notation block is created; either way content moves between sections |
| definition geography | D3/D4/D5 live in a section titled for tasks; foreign but adjacent, with recall refs from §2.2 pointing backward | every definition sits in the section titled for it; the cleanest geography available |
| numbering | Definitions 2.1-2.13 in source order; renumbering automatic (`preamble.tex:117`) | same; both orders renumber cleanly, `R11-def27` pins a LABEL, not a number |
| probes | zero of 21 break (49 A.6, independently re-enumerated there); three verbatim strings + the `def:fund:checkinlevel` label travel character-for-character | same verbatim strings must travel; 52 §3 measured zero gates constraining the ORDER, but the plan must be rebuilt, so probe survival is re-derived, not inherited |
| acyclicity claim in prose | the factorization remark and the D5 equations land inside §2.1; F-1/F-2/F-3 fixes required | the same corrected remark lands inside the leading representations section; same fixes required |
| residual asymmetry | the motivation (`:439-444`) trails its definitions | the task vocabulary of §2.2's narrative (seven sites) precedes the task definitions |

The honest summary: **(b) leaves the cleaner definitional structure; (a) leaves an equally sound
one with worse geography.** Neither leaves a defect. The residual asymmetries are duals of each
other: under (a) a definition precedes its motivating story; under (b) informal task language
precedes its formal definition. Both are prose-level, not symbol-level; 52 itself rated the (b)
version "lower severity (informal anchors are prose, not symbols)", and the same rating applies to
(a)'s version, in the other direction.

## 4. Is option (a) actually validated? The label, re-examined

52 called (a) "the already-validated option" (52 §5), and PENDENCIAS §6.24's decision menu repeats
it ("a subsubsecao do AD-4, que ja esta validada", `src_utils/PENDENCIAS.md:1633`). I do not
inherit the label. What 49 actually validated, and what it did not:

**Validated, and re-verified where it could be this session:** the dependency order (graph rebuilt
in 49 A.1); the well-formedness of the bindings ($c_p$ free today, $r_p$ unused; I confirmed the
step-1/step-2 target strings are live and unchanged at `:68-70` and `:76-77`); probe survival (zero
of 21 break, 49 A.6, with the PROBES tuple parsed mechanically); notation collisions ($\rho$ then
virgin tree-wide); glossary consistency. This is real validation and it was done adversarially.

**Not validated, in three concrete ways:**

1. **49's own blocking preconditions are not all met.** Part B says "Blocking preconditions
   (author, before any edit): decisions AD-1 through AD-4". AD-1, AD-5, AD-6, AD-7 are closed
   (`fundamentals/DEFINITIONS.md:576,:587-593`), AD-2 was closed as `[VERIFY]`
   (`src_utils/PENDENCIAS.md:1484`), but **AD-4, the sign-off on the §2.1 shape and the
   subsubsection's title, is open and CONDITIONAL** (the AD-4 row at `fundamentals/DEFINITIONS.md:590`:
   the given title lost a registered term when `place representation` was revoked, and "the title
   may be moot" pending exactly this inversion decision). AD-4 IS option (a)'s narrative cost in
   decision form. An option whose defining author decision is unresolved is not "validated"; it is
   mechanically checked and narratively unsigned.
2. **The validation is of a tree that has since moved.** 49 read a 1521-line chapter; the file is
   1527 lines today, with three later commits touching it (§0 above). The §2.1/§2.2 spans 49's
   steps target are byte-identical where I checked them, but under this repository's own law
   (AGENT_GUARDRAILS §4b V2/V5) a validation is re-taken, not carried, so application under (a)
   still begins with a re-derivation pass.
3. **49 never asked the narrative question.** Its seven Part A items are dependency, binding,
   factorization, static task, collisions, probes, glossary. Nothing in it evaluates what a reader
   loses when representation definitions sit inside a section titled for tasks; its one gesture in
   that direction is the A.1 prose-consistency note, which it routes to the author and does not
   answer. So "validated" is true of the mechanics and silent on the criterion the author has now
   made primary. The label, used as a decision aid, smuggles a narrative verdict that was never
   reached.

**Conclusion: (a) is mechanically validated, narratively unexamined until now, and gated on AD-4.**
Sections 2 and 5 of this document supply the missing narrative examination; with AD-4 resolved and
a coordinate re-derivation, (a) is applicable.

## 5. Cost per option, verified against the live tree

Every line was re-measured this session; line numbers are from today's files.

### Option (a): keep the order, move the definitions up

1. **AD-4 resolution (author).** The subsubsection's existence and head name. Open, conditional
   (`fundamentals/DEFINITIONS.md:590`). Blocking.
2. **Steps 1-2 of 49** (bind $c_p$/$r_p$ at `:68-70`; restate D1's attributes at `:76-77`). Target
   strings verified live and unchanged. Decision-independent; can land first.
3. **Steps 3-5 in ONE commit**: insert the subsubsection between `:109` and `:111`; remove the two
   environments at `:434-437` and `:461-465`, keeping the limitation paragraph (`:439-444`) and the
   recall at `:467`, both becoming backward references; adjust `:472-474` per the AD-2 outcome
   (closed as `[VERIFY]`, so the neutral wording rule of `src_utils/PENDENCIAS.md:1390-1397`
   applies: "uma funcao do POI visitado", no temporal qualification, never "aggregated").
4. **The corrected factorization remark** (F-1, F-2, F-3 fixes) and no padding claim near D2 (F-4).
5. **§2.1 opening sentence `:27-28` adjusted** so the section's stated scope covers what it now
   does; author approves the new shape (49 A.1 note).
6. **One-sentence motivating lead-in** in the new subsubsection (the repair for the motivation
   displacement of §2.2 item 2 above). New prose, author-approved (C2-class frame claim).
7. **Three new probes** (49 step 7), each sabotage-validated through `strip_text`, patterns
   re-derived from landed text.
8. **Coordinate re-derivation** before any edit (file drifted 1521 to 1527; §2.3 definitions moved
   about six lines).
9. **Zero touches** outside the chapter: no NORTH_STAR edit, no introduction edit, no tracker
   re-anchoring, no bridge rewrites, no §2.5 reorder. Verified: the three `sec:fund:*` refs
   (`:15`, `:17`, `:197`) all remain true under (a).
10. **GLOSSARY rows: already paid** (`GLOSSARY.md:45-46`).

### Option (b): invert

1. **Eight-step plan redone from scratch** before any edit (probe `R12-planvoid`,
   `src_utils/check_audit_claims.py:631-635`; `fundamentals/DEFINITIONS.md` §11). The redone plan is
   larger than 49, not a reindexing of it (52 §3 correction 3).
2. **`NORTH_STAR.md:73-80` map edit, the author's hand** (verified: `:74` "2.1 POI prediction
   tasks", `:75` "2.2 Representations for mobility").
3. **Chapter opening `:14-20` rewritten** (order narration); **`:27-28` rewritten** (becomes false,
   not stale).
4. **Migration of notation prose `:68-70` and Definitions 2.1/2.2 (`:71-78`, `:80-86`)** into the
   leading section or a pre-section notation block.
5. **Migration or replacement of the §2.1 entry material (`:27-38`)**: the LBSN context and the 93
   percent bound are the chapter's entry point; under (b) they move or the chapter opens cold. NOT
   covered by 52's condition C1 (see §6 item 6 below).
6. **Seven task-vocabulary sites inside §2.2** get informal anchors or local rewording (`:253`,
   `:272`, `:292`, `:300`, `:484-485`, `:563-564`, `src/tables/frame/lineage.tex:34`; all verified
   live).
7. **Bridge surgery**: `:194-197` ("This per-visit view motivates the representation discussed in
   Section~\ref{sec:fund:repr}") becomes a backward recall wearing a forward verb; a NEW bridge is
   written from the representations section into the tasks section.
8. **§2.5**: the enumeration at `:1415` reordered; the synthesis order at `:1431` ("The argument
   begins with the targets") becomes an author decision, re-argue or deliberately keep.
9. **`src/chapters/1_introduction.tex:258-260`** reordered (verified live).
10. **Tracker re-anchoring in the same commit**: PENDENCIAS §4 items 16-22
    (`src_utils/PENDENCIAS.md:1809-1827`, naming §2.1.1.1, §2.2.2, §2.2.3.1, §2.2.3.2);
    `src_utils/NEEDS_SIGN_OFF.md:169` (item 7, "na secao 2.1"); `NORTH_STAR.md:203-208` (paragraph
    pinned to "Section 2.2"); `storyline/README.md:21` (maps `02_tasks_and_scope/` to "Ch.2 §2.1").
11. **The placement layer of `fundamentals/DEFINITIONS.md` §1 (`:127-137`) is void** and must be
    marked so a future pass does not apply it as written.
12. **Four probe-pinned strings travel verbatim**; `check.sh` after application.
13. **Permanent, non-mechanical**: the divergence from the three papers' problem-first shape, and
    the answer-mirror reading order. These are the two authorial trades; no condition repairs them.
14. **Savings**: AD-4's subsubsection is dropped, and the definitional geography is the cleanest
    available (§3).

## 6. Where this study disagrees with `_round12/52`

1. **The recommendation.** 52 recommends invert-with-conditions; this study recommends keep. The
   evidence bases are nearly identical; the divergence is in §2.4's resolution of the mirror
   argument and in the pricing of (a), below.
2. **52 resolved the mirror argument by deference, not by argument.** Its §5 item 3 concedes the
   choice between mirrors is authorial, then resolves it with "the author's proposal indicates his
   judgment already leans to the answer-mirror". The suspension proves that reading wrong: his
   judgment was not settled, and treating an initial enthusiasm as the verdict is the sycophancy
   pattern AGENT_GUARDRAILS §7 names. The mirror question has a reader-side answer (§2.4), and it
   points the other way.
3. **52 priced only one side.** Its §3 cost table measures (b) meticulously and prices (a) at zero,
   as "the fallback". (a)'s narrative costs (title fidelity, motivation displacement, the pivot
   spent early) appear nowhere in it, and neither do (a)'s savings (no map edit, no bridges, no
   tracker re-anchoring, no introduction touch). A comparison cannot be won by measuring one
   contestant.
4. **The "already-validated" label.** 52 coined it and PENDENCIAS §6.24 repeats it. §4 above: the
   validation is mechanical, the tree has moved since, and the option's defining author decision
   (AD-4) is open. The label should not survive into the decision menu without those three
   qualifiers.
5. **The weight of the negative historical finding.** 52 §5 item 1 treats the absence of a recorded
   tasks-first rationale as dissolving the case for keeping. It dissolves only the TRADITION
   argument, which nobody needed to make. The present-tense reasons for tasks-first (the papers'
   shape, the reader's job, the first-read gate) do not depend on any recorded planning intent, and
   they survive the finding intact. Related, a reading 52 did not consider: the only prose
   defending the order was written by the author himself, inside his own clean-tree pass
   (`0bbe3caa`, verified this session, author `VitorHugoOli`, 2026-08-02), one day BEFORE he
   proposed the inversion. 52 counts that sentence only as "a restatement of the status quo"; it
   can equally be read as the instinct of the one reader who has read the whole chapter aloud most
   recently. I flag this as interpretation, not fact.
6. **A gap in 52's own condition set.** Its §2b item 5 identifies the §2.1 entry-material problem
   (the LBSN/93-percent context at `:27-38` must migrate or the chapter opens cold) and its §5
   marks C1 as covering "the notation + D1/D2 migration (§3 correction 3), the task-vocabulary
   anchors (§3 correction 4), the two seam rewrites (§4 item 1), and the §2.5 enumerations". The
   entry-material migration is in none of those four pointers. If the author chooses (b) after all,
   C1 must be extended with it.
7. **The git history claim, re-verified rather than inherited.** 52's original claim ("git history
   begins 2026-07-23") was false and was corrected by the parent. My own measurements, run this
   session from the repository root `/Users/vitor/Desktop/mestrado/ingred`:
   - `git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD` gives `cdba17dd`, dated **2025-03-08** ("setup").
   - `git rev-list --count HEAD` gives **2,051** (the correction note says 2,049; the repository
     has gained two commits since it was written, which is consistent with an active parallel
     agent, not a discrepancy).
   - `git rev-list --count HEAD --before='2026-07-23 00:00:00'` gives **1,666**. (The bare form
     `--before=2026-07-23` gives 1,672; the correction's 1,666 corresponds to the midnight cutoff.)
   - `git rev-list HEAD --before='2026-07-23 00:00:00' -- articles/dissertacao/` returns exactly
     ONE commit, `bb4449c8` (2026-07-20), and `git show --stat bb4449c8` confirms it adds
     `articles/dissertacao/.gitignore`, one file, one insertion.
   So the corrected finding stands as corrected: there is no earlier dissertation history in which
   a tasks-first rationale could hide.
8. **What this study does NOT dispute.** 52's §1 negative finding (no recorded rationale in
   `fundamentals/`); its three-refs/zero-gates measurements (re-verified: refs at `:15`, `:17`,
   `:197`, labels at `:25`, `:210`, nothing outside the chapter); its §3 corrections 1-4 and §4
   breakage list, all of which §5 above absorbs into (b)'s cost; and its five conditions, which
   remain the right condition set IF (b) is chosen.

## 7. Recommendation

**Recommendation (labeled as such; the author decides): OPTION (a), keep tasks-first, apply the
redesign through 49's plan with the condition set below.** The reasoning in one paragraph: both
options fix the definitional defect and both leave an acyclic, well-formed structure, so the
criterion is narrative; option (b)'s narrative costs are the two the author himself flagged by
suspending, they are permanent, and they sit at chapter scale where the reader lives; option (a)'s
narrative costs are real but local to one subsubsection, and every one of them is repairable by
prose that passes through his hands anyway. The cleaner definitional geography of (b) is a genuine
advantage, but it is a second-criterion advantage, and the author ranked the criteria.

**Conditions that make (a) safe:**

- **KC-1.** AD-4 is resolved FIRST, in its full form: the author sees the drafted §2.1 shape (the
  new subsubsection with its lead-in sentence) and names its head. If he rejects the shape on
  reading it, that rejection is the signal to reopen (b), because AD-4 is (a)'s narrative cost made
  visible. Nothing else lands before this.
- **KC-2.** The new subsubsection opens with one sentence tying the representations to the targets
  (the static task reads a representation; the sequential tasks read a history whose entries the
  map $\rho$ re-expresses), so the moved definitions are not met cold. New frame prose, C2
  sign-off.
- **KC-3.** The §2.1 opening sentence at `:27-28` is adjusted in the same commit so the section's
  stated scope matches its contents.
- **KC-4.** Coordinates are re-derived against the live tree at application (the file has moved
  since 49); steps 3-5 land in one commit (label-duplication hazard, 49 Part B); the three verbatim
  probe strings and the `def:fund:checkinlevel` label travel character-for-character; the three new
  probes are sabotage-validated through `strip_text` with the restore checked against provenance
  comments.
- **KC-5.** The F-1/F-2/F-3/F-4 corrections travel into the remark text regardless of anything
  else, and the AD-2 outcome is respected in the `:472-474` wording (neutral form; never "do
  timestamp da visita", never "aggregated").
- **KC-6.** The motivation displacement is either accepted explicitly by the author or repaired
  with ONE motivating clause beside the moved definitions (not the full CTLE story, which stays in
  §2.2 with the limitation paragraph).

**If the author chooses (b) despite this recommendation**, 52's five conditions stand, PLUS the
entry-material migration of §6 item 6 above added to C1, and the redone plan prices §5's items 1-13
per item before any edit.

## [VERIFY] flags

1. [VERIFY: the author's criterion sentence ("mantem a MELHOR NARRATIVA e corrige os problemas de
   definicao") is quoted from the task brief; a grep for it across the repository's markdown
   returned zero hits, so it is not independently confirmable on disk.]
2. [VERIFY: §6 item 5's reading of the `:27-28` sentence as the author's own reader-instinct is an
   interpretation; commit `0bbe3caa` attributes the tree to his pass but does not distinguish
   keystrokes, exactly as 52's flag 2 already records.]
3. [VERIFY: 52's claim that zero probes constrain section ORDER was re-checked only through its own
   evidence trail and the probe file's matcher structure (file-scoped `re.search` over `live_text`,
   `check_audit_claims.py:614-658,:701` per 49 A.6); the 21-probe enumeration itself was not re-run
   probe by probe this session. Under option (a) that enumeration exists (49 A.6); under option (b)
   it must be redone as part of the new plan.]
4. [VERIFY: the seven task-vocabulary sites were verified as live prose by reading sed spans around
   each; the count "seven" (six chapter sites plus the lineage table row) matches 52; a
   comment-stripped sweep for FURTHER task-vocabulary sites in §2.2 was not run, so seven is a
   floor confirmed, not a ceiling proven.]

## UNFINISHED

Nothing in the assigned scope is unfinished. Two things were deliberately not attempted, by scope:
no redone edit plan for option (b) (gated behind the author's decision), and no probe-by-probe
re-run of 49's A.6 enumeration (its structure and matcher were re-verified; the per-probe table was
not re-derived, see [VERIFY] 3).

Wall clock, self-reported and to be measured independently by the parent: approximately 1787
seconds when this file was completed (measured: date +%s deltas against the session start stamp), inside the 2,400-second checkpoint. The parent's measurement
governs.
