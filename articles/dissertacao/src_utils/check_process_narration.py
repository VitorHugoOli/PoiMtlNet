"""check_process_narration.py -- prose may not narrate how the work was done.

THE DEFECT IT ANSWERS. The author read Appendix F on 2026-07-30 and found this in the deposited
prose: "California, Texas, and Istanbul were absent from an earlier version of this appendix, and
their absence was a matter of computational resource rather than of principle: the machine that would
have run them was out of disk." His objection was exact -- a dissertation states what is true, and a
lab machine's free space is not a fact about mobility data. He also asked whether the governing
documents banned it. They did not: `grep -cin "process narration|out of disk|the machine that"` over
AGENT_GUARDRAILS.md and WRITING_LAW.md returned 0 and 0. The rule is now WRITING_LAW §1, and this file
is its enforcement.

WHY A GATE AND NOT JUST A RULE. Every other prose gate here exists because a rule alone did not hold:
the trapped-prose, torn-sentence and doubled-macro classes were each written down before they were
gated, and each recurred. Process narration is the easiest class to reintroduce, because an agent that
has just done difficult work is the one most tempted to explain the difficulty.

FOUR SUB-CLASSES, each pattern taken from a real instance rather than imagined:
  infrastructure       "out of disk", "the machine that", GPU/queue/wall-clock/checkpoint mentions
  version history      "an earlier version of this appendix", "originally reported"
  effort scheduling    "computational resource", "were measured afterward", "at the time of writing"
  writing self-talk    "the paragraph above", "as noted above", "this appendix originally"

SCOPE. Live prose only: comments are stripped with the SAME `(?<!\\)%` rule the audit gate uses, since
provenance comments quote the banned sentences verbatim and must not be flagged -- this file's own
docstring would trip a comment-blind checker. Scope is derived from the filesystem with a FLOOR, not
hardcoded: a chapter split silently shrank a prose gate's scope twice on this project, and both times
the gate reported a clean sweep of almost nothing.

TWO DELIBERATE EXEMPTIONS, both narrow:
  - apx_b_errata.tex and tables/*/errata.tex: the errata appendix's PURPOSE is to record what changed
    between the published and reproduced text. Version history is its subject matter.
  - apx_c_ai_disclosure.tex: a disclosure appendix must describe the process by which the document was
    written. That is the one place where narrating the work IS the content.
Anything else is in scope, including the frame chapters and every appendix.
