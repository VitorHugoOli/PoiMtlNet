# CODEX_AUDIT.md — audit of `src_utils/codex_reviewer.md`

**Audit date:** 2026-07-27.
**Document audited:** `src_utils/codex_reviewer.md` (1,419 lines; 18 COD findings, an
eight-row numerical-corrections table, a chapter-by-chapter section, and a
reviewer-agreements section). The review dates itself 26 July 2026 and names repository
state `70d3888d`.
**Audited against:** `src/chapters/*.tex` and `src/0_main.tex` as they stand now;
`src/dissertacao.pdf` (**102 pp**, written 2026-07-27 07:47) and
`src/build/main_final.pdf` (**97 pp**, 07:56); the committed result artifacts under
`docs/results/` and `docs/studies/`; the CoUrb-era codebase at
`/Users/vitor/Desktop/mestrado/temp/tarik-new`; the DGI and HGI preprocessing code under
`research/embeddings/`; the state corpora at `data/checkins_by_state/`; and the v2
persona reports in `src_utils/_review_v2/` and `src_utils/_specialists_v2/`.
**Read-only.** Nothing under `src/` was modified. No git command was run. This file is
the only file written.

> **Concurrent-edit disclosure (2026-07-27, 08:53–08:55).** While this audit was being
> written, `src/chapters/6_conclusion.tex`, `src/chapters/4_courb.tex`,
> `src/chapters/apx_b_errata.tex` and `src/references.bib` were modified by another hand,
> and two of the repairs this file recommends were applied. **COD-010 / NUM-1 / NUM-2:**
> the capacity sentence at `6_conclusion.tex:116-118` now reads "the widened model was
> fitted under three training configurations, twenty models each and sixty in total, and
> the strongest configuration averages 56.16 macro-F1, standard deviation 1.89" — the
> count, the statistic and the missing spread are all corrected, so that finding is now
> **RESOLVED** rather than CONFIRMED, and item 1 of §6 is done. **COD-008 (Mikolov):**
> `4_courb.tex:208` now cites `mikolov2013word2vec,mikolov2013negsampling`, the new entry
> is at `references.bib:685`, and `apx_b_errata.tex` carries a new errata row for it, so
> item 4 of §6 is done. Every COD-010 and COD-008 verdict below describes the state at the
> time of audit and is superseded on those two points only; line numbers throughout were
> re-resolved against the live files after the change. Nothing else in the four files moved
> a verdict — I re-checked each cited line. **The PDFs were then rebuilt at 08:59 and are now
> 103 and 98 pages.** Page references in this file were taken from the 07:47/07:56 pair at
> 102/97 pages, so I re-located every load-bearing site in the new build and compared: the
> Ch.5 trunk sentence (p74), the withheld attribution (pp. 73 and 77), the Ch.6 gradient
> scope (p78), the capacity sentence (p77), the Ch.1 objective (p15), the Ch.5 integrity
> limits (p66), the Markov figure (p73), the Appendix B float table (pp. 95–96) and the
> label-history term (pp. 8, 12, 66, 98) are all on the same pages as before. The one added
> page falls at the end of Appendix E, which now runs to p103. **Every page number in this
> file is therefore still correct.**
>
> **The review was written against a superseded artifact.** It reviews a 97/92-page pair;
> the current pair is 102/97 pages, rebuilt after the correction round of 2026-07-27. Six
> of the eighteen findings are wholly or partly resolved by that round. That does not make
> the review careless: at its own timestamp most of what it reported was there. It does
> mean every "Open" status in its tracking table must be re-read before it is acted on,
> and this file is that re-reading.

## 1 · Summary table

| Finding | Claimed severity | Verdict | One-line reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| COD-001 three comment-swallowed sentences | Critical | **RESOLVED** | All three render: "Nash-MTL treats" p23, "a capacity-matched dedicated baseline" p77, "The emphasis convention" p89; four more of the class were found and fixed; the checker now passes 10 fixtures before its own result is trusted |
| COD-002 Ch.4 static result is target-derived and still drives the arc | Critical | **PARTLY** (determinism CONFIRMED and widened; disclosure CONFIRMED absent; "still drives the arc" PARTLY) | `spot`→`category` purity is 1.0 at all five states (measured); no rendered page states it; but Ch.4 is only one of two supports for the diagnosis and the width confound is now disclosed in Ch.6 |
| COD-003 exact Check2HGI lineage never had the nonlinear future-edge test | Major | **PARTLY** (channel and lineage gap CONFIRMED; "overclaims" REFUTED in Ch.5, CONFIRMED at one Ch.1 site) | Ch.5 :391 states the linear form, the Florida-only single-seed scope, the ancestor-build lineage, and the failed screen; the one global word left is "leakage-guarded" at `1_introduction.tex:158` |
| COD-004 operational success conflated with transfer and a trunk mechanism | Major | **PARTLY** | The withholding is stated twice (Ch.5 :713, Ch.6 :101) and the ablation is disclosed as unusable; the contrary attribution survives verbatim at `5_mobiwac.tex:872` (p74) |
| COD-005 PCGrad and Nash-MTL evidence misstated | Major | **PARTLY** | Wiring defect and unsupported cost claim CONFIRMED at source; the author has ruled on PCGrad and Nash separately; the screen's seed/state scope is still absent from prose |
| COD-006 statistical wording exceeds the design | Major | **PARTLY** | "before any result was read" and "well powered" are CONFIRMED overstatements; "identically" is REFUTED as reported (the sentence names the asymmetry itself); n=4 and the fixed partition are already stated |
| COD-007 Ch.3–4 methodologically under-specified | Major | **PARTLY / NEEDS-AUTHOR** | The missing Ch.3 records and unspecified Ch.4 checkpoint rule are CONFIRMED; the "significant/outperforms survives" half is largely REFUTED (Appendix B documents four removals and accounts for all six surviving uses) |
| COD-008 load-bearing citations do not support their claims | Major | **PARTLY** | Mikolov negative-sampling mismatch CONFIRMED (1301.3781 has no negative sampling); Standley overreach CONFIRMED; UberNet/Sphere2Vec preprints CONFIRMED (versions of record exist); the scikit-learn claim is REFUTED as a support failure |
| COD-009 CoUrb translation and adaptation records lag the text | Major | **PARTLY** | The single-seed sentence is already scoped to the released code (verified firsthand in `create_fold.py`); the stale inventory, English-donor source-of-record, and the "no claim altered" tension are CONFIRMED |
| COD-010 capacity control miscounted and over-compressed | Moderate | **CONFIRMED** | "across three training configurations and all twenty fitted models" still renders on p77; the artifact is 20 per arm, 60 total, and 56.16 is the best arm's mean (SD 1.89) |
| COD-011 privacy, ethics, licensing absent | Major | **RESOLVED** | Appendix E "Data Ethics and Governance" is in the build (pp. 101–102), with licences re-verified at source and the CEP/IRB position recorded as a position, not an approval |
| COD-012 both artifacts fail the UFV gate | Critical | **PARTLY** | Bibliography now measures 11.96 pt, body size (measured p81), so that half is RESOLVED; cover, approval sheet, committee, date, font ruling and process documents remain NEEDS-AUTHOR |
| COD-013 AI disclosure ahead of the recorded approval state | Major | **CONFIRMED** (count corrected) | Appendix C claims the author "takes responsibility for every word" while 31 `[NEEDS SIGN-OFF]` markers remain in `src/`, not 27 |
| COD-014 "ceiling" and the Markov causal story | Moderate | **RESOLVED** | "label-history benchmark" throughout with "not an upper bound" stated; the Markov paragraph now states protocol asymmetry system by system and disclaims a single cause |
| COD-015 cross-chapter seams | Moderate | **PARTLY** | Four of six sub-claims hold: Ch.6 still says "three of the six datasets" where the measurement pools four Gowalla states, the MRR and relative-multi-task promises are still unused, the frame and Ch.4 disagree on the Gowalla vintage, and the Ch.3 preface clause understates Ch.5's changes; the next-POI bridge and the cross-reference targets are REFUTED |
| COD-016 language and readability pass | Moderate | **PARTLY** | The 114-word abstract result sentence and the 546-word integrity block are CONFIRMED burdens; the `3_cbic.tex:340` "unrecoverable" sentence is REFUTED (the quoted words are published prose and their meaning is recoverable) |
| COD-017 visual and typographic inconsistencies | Moderate | **PARTLY** | The oversized Appendix B float (21.55853 pt) and 6.97/7.27 pt diagram labels on pp. 62 and 64 are CONFIRMED by measurement; the Portuguese figure labels are RESOLVED; the "nearly blank p.4 with orphaned keywords" is CONFIRMED |
| COD-018 governance files and gates no longer describe the artifact | Moderate | **PARTLY** | Page counts in `CLAUDE.md`, `PLAN.md`, `HANDOFF_v1.md` are stale (89/84 against 102/97) and Appendix A lacks per-role CoUrb credit; the checker and `pypdfium2` sub-claims are RESOLVED |
| NUM-1 capacity "three configurations / twenty fits" | — | **CONFIRMED** | Same defect as COD-010; still on p77 |
| NUM-2 capacity 56.16 reads as best individual fit | — | **CONFIRMED** | Artifact: best arm mean 56.16, SD 1.89; the chapter's own ledger comment already flags the missing spread |
| NUM-3 gradient scope "three of six" | — | **PARTLY** | Ch.5 :204 is fixed and names Georgia; `6_conclusion.tex:177` still says "three of the six datasets" |
| NUM-4 HGI 0.74→0.82 basis | — | **CONFIRMED as a live `[VERIFY]`** | Source gives 0.7388 ± 0.0205 → 0.8186 ± 0.0123 over 5 folds × 50 epochs; the prose rounds and drops both spreads |
| NUM-5 Arizona rounding by 0.01 | — | **REFUTED as stated** | Every AZ figure in the document is on one basis (joint-best): 65.79, 59.46, +9.35 all trace to `JOINT_BEST_RESULTS.md`; the 0.01 wobble named in the artifact belongs to the diagnostic-best basis, which the document does not use |
| NUM-6 label-history called a ceiling | — | **RESOLVED** | Zero occurrences of "label-only ceiling", "autocorrelation ceiling", or "what the past itself allows" in either PDF |
| NUM-7 CoUrb 20.2–22.0 reads as a deployable fixed encoder | — | **PARTLY** | The per-cell-best convention is stated at all three Ch.4 sites and in Appendix B, so it is disclosed; it is not disclosed at the two frame sites (`1_introduction.tex:113`, `6_conclusion.tex:46`), and the word "oracle" appears nowhere |
| NUM-8 Wilcoxon n=20 can read as independent | — | **RESOLVED** | Ch.5 :418 names n=4 as the inferential unit and reports the fold-level test "alongside it"; the Glossary carries the same footing |

**Counts, tallied from the rows above.** Of the 18 COD items: **3 RESOLVED**
(COD-001, COD-011, COD-014), **2 CONFIRMED** (COD-010, COD-013), **12 PARTLY**
(COD-002, COD-003, COD-004, COD-005, COD-006, COD-008, COD-009, COD-012, COD-015,
COD-016, COD-017, COD-018), and **1 PARTLY / NEEDS-AUTHOR** (COD-007). Of the 8
numerical rows: **2 RESOLVED** (NUM-6, NUM-8), **3 CONFIRMED** (NUM-1, NUM-2, and NUM-4
as a live `[VERIFY]`), **2 PARTLY** (NUM-3, NUM-7), and **1 REFUTED** (NUM-5).
Zero findings are wholly fabricated. Two are wrong as stated (NUM-5; the COD-016
"unrecoverable sentence"), and four are materially understated or misdirected (COD-002's
second half, COD-003's Ch.1 site, COD-006's "identically", COD-008's scikit-learn row).

## 2 · Finding-by-finding evidence

### COD-001 — three comment-swallowed sentences · **RESOLVED**

All three sentences render in the current defense PDF. Text extracted from
`src/dissertacao.pdf` and searched page by page:

| Named missing phrase | Renders on |
|---|---|
| "Nash-MTL treats" | p23 (`2_fundamentals.tex:359`) |
| "a capacity-matched dedicated baseline, run after the" | p77 (`6_conclusion.tex:112`) |
| "The emphasis convention of the published category table, which" | p89 (`apx_b_errata.tex:174`) |

The review's claim that the checker "is not a valid release gate" was true of the
checker it saw and is no longer true. `src_utils/test_trapped_prose.py` now carries ten
fixtures, seven positive and three negative, and reports `10/10 fixtures pass`. Four of
the seven positives are defects found *after* the review: `apx_a` (a fragment after a
terminal period), `4_courb:187` (half a published methodology sentence),
`5_mobiwac:385` (four sentences including a required disclosure), and
`6_conclusion:110` (a one-word swallowed sentence-opener, found by persona 16 on
2026-07-27). `src_utils/check.sh:59-71` runs the fixtures first and captures the exit
status in a variable rather than through a pipe, with a comment recording that the pipe
form had shipped once as an unreachable failure branch. `check_trapped_prose.py ../src`
returns `trapped-prose suspects: 0`.

**Nothing to do.** The review's recommended action is already executed and exceeded.

### COD-002 — Ch.4 static category result is target-derived but still drives the arc · **PARTLY**

This is the review's most consequential claim and it splits cleanly into three parts.

**Part 1, the determinism: CONFIRMED, and wider than the review states.** I measured it
directly on the committed corpora rather than accepting either the review's or persona
11's number:

| state | rows | distinct `spot` values | max target classes per `spot` | impure `spot` values |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Alabama | 113,846 | 284 | 1 | 0 |
| Arizona | 236,450 | 305 | 1 | 0 |
| Florida | 1,407,034 | 324 | 1 | 0 |
| California | 3,171,380 | 333 | 1 | 0 |
| Texas | 4,089,892 | 365 | 1 | 0 |

(measured on `data/checkins_by_state/<state>.parquet`, grouping `spot` against
`category`; `max_cat_per_placeid` is also 1 everywhere.) The chain is readable in code:
`4_courb.tex:208` states that each random walk "is converted into a sequence of secondary
categories (*fclass*)" and `:219` that the POI encoder carries a hierarchical
regularization term over `(category, fclass)` pairs, so the place vector is a function of
the fine category; the fine category determines the target exactly. The Alabama shuffle
control at
`docs/archive/fusion-study/results/P0/leakage_ablation/alabama/comparison.json` gives
`cat_f1` 0.7855417728 → 0.1436618567 under `C_fclass_shuffle` against
`next_f1` 0.2383448780 → 0.1988023221, and that folder's own README calls the arm "the
decisive test" and concludes that "Category F1 on this dataset primarily measures
fclass-identity preservation, not learned representation quality."

**Part 2, the disclosure: CONFIRMED absent.** Across all 102 rendered pages, `fclass`
occurs once (p51, inside Ch.4's own encoder description); `0.7855`, `0.1437`, "shuffle
control", "label propagation" and "oracle" occur zero times. `homophily` occurs once,
on p20, in an unrelated Ch.2 passage. No appendix carries the measurement: the appendix
list at `0_main.tex:400-404` is A contributions, B errata, C AI disclosure, D
label-history benchmark, E ethics, and a grep for `fclass` or "determin" across
`chapters/apx_*.tex` returns only the word "determination" in Appendix E's CEP/IRB
paragraph. The author's own ruling in `src_utils/PENDENCIAS.md:145-150` authorizes exactly
this appendix ("eu acredito que valha um appendix para isso ou inserimos essa discução em
um dos appendix, e no prefacio do courb apontamos para esse apendix") and it has not been
written.

**Part 3, "STILL DRIVES the thesis arc": PARTLY, and the review overstates it.** I read
the four sites it names. What the document actually does:

- `1_introduction.tex:113-116` — "Category performance rose sharply at every state
  tested. The diagnosis followed: at that stage of the research, the input
  representation, not the sharing architecture, was the bottleneck." The static number
  is not quoted here, but "rose sharply" is the static result and nothing scopes it.
  **The review is right about this site.**
- `6_conclusion.tex:45-55` — quotes the 20.2 to 22.0 figure, then immediately states the
  width confound: "The comparison is not width-matched, however: the decomposed input is
  wider than the place embedding it replaces, 192 dimensions against 64", and attributes
  the equal-dimension control to Ch.4. So one confound is disclosed here and the other is
  not. **Partly right.**
- `2_fundamentals.tex:56-57` — defines category classification as labelling a POI "from
  static features rather than from a sequence", neutrally, with no claim resting on it.
  **The review's Ch.2 charge does not hold.**
- Ch.4 itself carries the per-cell-best convention at all three sites (:40, :318, :419)
  and a preface (:18) that time-indexes the chapter and states the sample-stratified
  split. The static task is not presented as target-blind, but nor is it flagged as
  target-derived.

Two facts weaken the review's framing further. First, the arc does not rest on the static
number alone: Ch.4's sequential result (15 of 21 combinations plus one technical tie, per
`apx_b_errata.tex:280-284`) is independent of the shortcut, and persona 11 verified that
the shuffle moves the sequential task by only about 4 points, not to chance. Second, the
author's own reading in `PENDENCIAS.md:146` limits the problem to CoUrb, not CBIC, because
Ch.3's DGI path is different — and the code bears that out:
`research/embeddings/dgi/preprocess.py:115` builds a one-hot of the seven-class target and
`:130` replaces each node's feature with the *neighbours'* mean of that one-hot, with
`research/embeddings/dgi/dgi.py:56` feeding `embedding_array_test` as `data.x`. That is label propagation over
a transductive graph, not self-lookup.

**Fixable without the author?** No, and for two different reasons. The measurement and
the appendix text are mechanical, but (a) the disclosure touches a published,
co-authored chapter whose first author is Tarik S. Paiva, and the author has already
identified a courtesy notice as a precondition; and (b) rewriting
`1_introduction.tex:113-116` changes the arc sentence, which is a C2 claim under
`AGENT_GUARDRAILS §3`. **NEEDS-AUTHOR.** What a fix would consist of, precisely: an
appendix section carrying the five-state purity table above and the arm-C numbers with
their single-fold single-seed footing; a Ch.4 preface pointer to it; one clause in
`1_introduction.tex:114` scoping "rose sharply" to the static task and naming the
sequential result as the part that survives; and one limitation bullet in Ch.6 §6.2.

### COD-003 — exact reported Check2HGI lineage has not closed the future-edge channel · **PARTLY**

The review asks the right question and then answers a slightly different one. I audited
the second half as instructed: not whether more testing is possible, but whether the
document overclaims relative to what it ran.

**What Ch.5 states.** `5_mobiwac.tex:391`, rendering on pp. 66–67: "The measurement
bounds this channel rather than closing it, and three limits set how far it reaches: the
probe is linear, it was run at Florida alone at one random initialization over five
user-grouped folds, and it was run on those ancestor builds of the representation rather
than on the one that produced the results reported here. The same record shows why the
linear form is a screen and not a proof, since one encoder that passed it leaked under a
downstream sequence model." The bidirectional link is stated in the same paragraph at
:376: "A visit's node is linked to the visit that follows it, and category is a node
input feature, so a per-visit vector could in principle absorb the category of the next
visit."

Every element the review demands is therefore already on the page: the channel is named,
the probe's linearity is named, the Florida-and-one-seed scope is named, the
ancestor-lineage gap is named, and the counter-example (an encoder that passed the linear
screen and leaked downstream) is volunteered. The paragraph also names the
transductivity audit's coverage limit ("67 to 87 percent"; visits to unseen places "the
one part it cannot reach"), which matches
`docs/studies/pre_freeze_gates/A4_RESULTS.md:59-63` (AL 66.8%, AZ 71.9%, FL 86.9%), and
that source's own caveat that the category measurement is "a POI-level proxy on the ~67%
in-coverage subset, not the exact check-in-level setup."

**So the review's "still allows global wording that reads as though the shipped
representation were leakage-cleared" is REFUTED for Ch.5.** I swept both PDFs for
"leakage-guarded", "leakage-free", "leak-free", "no leakage", "rules out leakage" and
"clean of leakage". There is exactly one hit in rendered prose, and it is not in Ch.5.

**CONFIRMED at one site the review did not name.** `1_introduction.tex:158`, specific
objective 4, promises to "Anchor the final answer to the research question in a
**leakage-guarded** statistical protocol, the user-disjoint cross-validation with paired
significance and non-inferiority testing of Chapter 5". It renders on p15. Read against
Ch.5's own :391, "leakage-guarded" is stronger than the evidence: the user-disjoint split
guards the *split*, which is true and defensible, but the phrase reads as a property of
the representation pipeline, which is precisely the thing Ch.5 says it bounded rather
than closed. One further site is adjacent: `apx_a_contributions.tex:64` uses "leak-free
per-fold region-transition prior" inside a comment, so it does not render.

**Also CONFIRMED: the audit-population mismatch is real but unstated.** The A4 audit ran
on the non-overlapping windowing and a POI-level proxy; the board runs stride-1 sliding
windows. Ch.5 states the coverage limit and the proxy nature in the integrity paragraph
but does not state that the audit population differs from the result-window population.

**Fixable without the author?** The `1_introduction.tex:158` wording is a one-clause
repair with no number and no new claim: replace "a leakage-guarded statistical protocol"
with the protocol's actual named guarantee, "a user-disjoint statistical protocol". It is
in a `[NEEDS SIGN-OFF]`-free sentence but it is an objective statement, so I would put it
to the author as a one-line approval rather than apply it silently. The exact-lineage
rerun is **NEEDS-AUTHOR** and is a research decision, not an edit; the review's own
recommendation (option 2, retain as conditional evidence with the channel stated adjacent
to the headline) is already what Ch.5 does, so the honest reading is that option 2 is
*already taken* and only the Ch.1 word contradicts it.

### COD-004 — operational success conflated with transfer and a trunk mechanism · **PARTLY**

**The withholding is now stated, twice, and more strongly than the review credits.**
`5_mobiwac.tex:703-714` reports the freeze control, then: "we attribute the gain to the
joint architecture rather than to any named component of it", then the Florida
cross-attention removal at $-0.04 \pm 0.13$, then two reasons not to read that as an
absence of contribution ("an earlier configuration whose region head was driven by a
transition prior the models reported here do not use", and "the development record that
produced it reads the null as a compensation effect"), closing: "We therefore do not name
the shared trunk as the source, and we do not present the ablation as evidence against it
either." `6_conclusion.tex:95-103` carries the parallel passage. Both render, on pp. 73
and 77. This is the disclosure the correction round claims, and it is real: the underlying
record at `docs/findings/archive/F50/F50_T1_5_CROSSATTN_ABSORPTION.md:229` does call its
own null "misleading" and a "hidden compensation effect".

**The contrary attribution survives.** `5_mobiwac.tex:872`, the opening sentence of §5.7
Discussion and Limitations, rendering on p74: "One model serves both tasks: the shared
trunk carries the semantic context that lifts the next-category task, and the private
spatial path keeps the next-region task competitive." That is a component attribution, one
page after the document says it will not make one. The review is right, and the defect is
sharpened rather than softened by the correction round: the round strengthened the
withholding at :713 and left the contradiction at :872 intact, so the two now sit closer
together.

**Fixable without the author?** Yes, and it is the single highest-value one-sentence
repair in the document. The fix keeps the sentence's function (it introduces the
discussion by naming what the model achieves) and drops the mechanism: "One model serves
both tasks: it reaches the next-category gain and keeps the next-region task competitive,
with the region output retaining a private spatial path." No number moves, no result
changes, and it removes a contradiction a committee will find in thirty seconds. Because
it is interpretive prose in a re-typeset chapter, it belongs in Appendix B's departure
list, which is why I flag it for approval rather than call it free.

### COD-005 — PCGrad and Nash-MTL evidence still misstated · **PARTLY**

Four sub-claims, all confirmed at source but with different owners: PCGrad's invalidity
(already ruled on by the author), the screen's missing scope (the one unaddressed gap),
the Nash cost claim (confirmed and already disclosed in Appendix B), and the Nash
guarantee wording.

**PCGrad's invalidity: CONFIRMED at source; the naming is an author ruling, not an
oversight.** `docs/results/mtl_improvement/T4_audit_and_verdict.md:26-31` states that
under the dual tower "the private reg tower (>80% of the reg pathway) trains at unit
weight always" and that cagrad/pcgrad/aligned_mtl "**don't count** as balancer tests;
they reduce to ≈equal-weighting by construction". The chapter's own comment at
`5_mobiwac.tex:186-201` reproduces this and records the recommendation to drop the two
words — explicitly "NOT applied — the author's instruction governs". The author's decision
is at `PENDENCIAS.md:180-184`: he wants PCGrad named so that an acid MTL reviewer can see
it was tried, on the grounds that it produced no result even before the private tower
existed. **NEEDS-AUTHOR**, already decided, and the review is re-litigating a settled
ruling without knowing it was settled.

**The screen's scope: CONFIRMED absent.** T4's own precision note says what ran was "the
full screen at **registry DEFAULTS, seed 0, AL+FL**". Neither the seed nor the two states
appears in Ch.5's prose. This is the part of COD-005 that is a genuine, unaddressed
number-protocol gap under `AGENT_GUARDRAILS N5` (convention named).

**The Nash cost claim: CONFIRMED as a defect, and already disclosed as one.**
`3_cbic.tex:237` reproduces the published "requires only two matrix-vector products per
iteration". `apx_b_errata.tex:160-172` preserves it deliberately and names it: "it is not
supported by the method's own paper: the phrase does not appear there, and both
implementations we examined run an iterative concave-convex procedure whose default is
twenty passes, each a convex solve, on top of one backward pass per task. The claim
therefore understates the optimizer's cost." That paragraph renders on p89. The review's
statement that the claim is "known to be unsupported while remaining live in the chapter"
is true of the chapter and false of the document, which discloses it in the appendix built
for exactly this purpose. The open question is only whether to correct rather than
report, and `PENDENCIAS.md:250` puts that to the author with a recommendation to keep as
is. **NEEDS-AUTHOR.**

**The Nash guarantee wording: CONFIRMED, minor.** `4_courb.tex:120` says Nash-MTL "seeks
the update direction that maximizes the product of the utilities of all tasks, which
ensures that the update is beneficial for all tasks simultaneously". "Ensures" is
unconditional; the guarantee holds under the method's assumptions. This is published
co-authored prose, so it is an errata-policy question, not a free edit.

### COD-006 — statistical wording exceeds the design · **PARTLY**

**"before any result was read": CONFIRMED as an overstatement.**
`5_mobiwac.tex:418` says "A written analysis plan, fixed during development and before any
result was read". The plan itself,
`docs/studies/closing_data/v17_completion/STATISTICAL_PROTOCOL.md`, is headed
"PRE-REGISTERED. Commit this BEFORE the board unblinds" — which is a claim about the
*board*, not about all prior results. Its own §3.2 justifies the two-point margin partly
on pilot evidence: "the adopted gated-overlap board widened the matched reg gap from
~−0.31 pp (non-overlap, 'visibly ties') to ~−1.2 pp (FL, 2 seeds). A −1.2 pp gap with σ~1.0
**passes** TOST non-inferiority at δ_reg = 2 pp." A margin chosen with a two-seed Florida
gap in hand was not chosen before any result was read. The chapter's phrase is defensible
as "before the final board was read" and is not defensible as written.

**"The equivalence is well powered": CONFIRMED as post-hoc precision.**
`5_mobiwac.tex:418` supports it with "the paired difference's standard deviation is 0.01
to 0.18 points across the datasets" — observed variance, i.e. achieved precision, not
prospective power.

**"identically": REFUTED as the review states it.** The review says the document "says
selection is applied identically to both arms, while dedicated models use task-best epochs
and the joint model uses a geometric-mean joint selector". Both halves are on the page, in
the same chapter, and the chapter says so itself. `5_mobiwac.tex:523-527`: "every reported
model is one saved artifact per fold, read at its validation-selected epoch: each
dedicated model at its task's best epoch, and the joint model at the epoch selected by its
joint validation score (the geometric mean of the two task metrics)". The word
"identically" at `:880` is doing different work in its own sentence: "the selection rule is
applied identically to both arms on the same folds, and the dedicated arm receives the
wider search", followed by "It does not follow that the bias cancels exactly." The rule
(select on validation, per fold) is identical; the per-arm objective is disclosed two
pages earlier. This is loose but it is not the contradiction claimed, and the
non-cancellation caveat the review asks for is already the next sentence.

**n=4 and the fixed partition: already stated.** `:418` gives "$4\times5=20$ measurements
and the tests pair the per-seed means ($n{=}4$)"; `:880` adds "The four seeds also reuse
one fixed fold partition, so the reported intervals cover variation across random
initializations and not across resampled user splits."

**Fixable without the author?** Two clauses are, and both are narrowings that cannot
strengthen a claim: "before any result was read" → "before the final result board was
read", and "The equivalence is well powered" → a statement of the observed interval
precision, conditional on the fixed split, using the numbers already in the sentence.
Both are `[NEEDS SIGN-OFF]`-class because they touch the statistical protocol paragraph
that the whole Ch.5 verdict rests on.

### COD-007 — Chapters 3–4 methodologically under-specified · **PARTLY / NEEDS-AUTHOR**

**The missing records: CONFIRMED.** Ch.3 states 5-fold cross-validation at :294 and never
identifies the split axis, seed count, tuning budget, or checkpoint rule. Ch.2 discloses
this rather than hiding it: `2_fundamentals.tex:496-500` says "Chapter 3 reports five-fold
cross-validation without identifying the split axis, Chapter 4 states that its split is
stratified by sample rather than by user ... and only Chapter 5 splits by user."
Ch.4's checkpoint rule is indeed unspecified. Whether the originals are recoverable is
**NEEDS-AUTHOR** (the CBIC codebase was not provided to this audit).

**The inferential-verb half: largely REFUTED.** The review says "'significant,'
'statistical,' 'outperforms,' and 'consistently' language survives in places", which
implies the round did not act. It did. `apx_b_errata.tex:196-200` records that four
statements had *significant/significantly/statistically* removed, with the published and
chapter wordings printed side by side at :239-252, and states the reason: "the chapter
reports no inferential test of any kind, so these words claimed more than the study
established". :200-208 then accounts for every surviving use: four are not about the
chapter's own results (two report cited work, one states the hypothesis, one names a
target level), and two that *are* about its own results are kept deliberately because
they qualify negative findings, so removing them "would make the chapter's own conclusion
sound stronger than it was". I verified the survivors at `3_cbic.tex:60, 62, 68, 90, 209,
414, 423` and the accounting holds. That is a documented, reasoned disposition, not
leftover residue.

**The oracle-envelope half: PARTLY, see NUM-7.** Ch.4 states the per-cell convention at
all three of its own sites; the frame does not.

### COD-008 — load-bearing citations do not support their claims · **PARTLY**

I re-verified each of the four against the source of record rather than against the
review or persona 05.

**The Mikolov negative-sampling mismatch: CONFIRMED.** `4_courb.tex:208` says the
embeddings are learned "using the *skip-gram* strategy with *negative sampling*
\cite{mikolov2013word2vec}". The bib entry is *Efficient Estimation of Word
Representations in Vector Space*, arXiv:1301.3781. I pulled both abstracts from the arXiv
API: 1301.3781 mentions neither negative sampling nor hierarchical softmax; the
negative-sampling paper is arXiv:1310.4546, *Distributed Representations of Words and
Phrases and their Compositionality*, whose abstract carries both terms. The citing clause
therefore attributes a method to the paper that does not contain it. Note the irony worth
recording: `apx_b_errata.tex:522` documents replacing `church2017word2vec` with
`mikolov2013word2vec` at this very site, so the repair fixed one mis-citation and left a
support mismatch.

**Standley: CONFIRMED as an overreach.** `3_cbic.tex:210` claims "hard parameter sharing
frequently matches or exceeds the performance of more complex architectures on many
benchmarks, while offering faster training and inference \cite{standley2020tasks}". The
paper's abstract (arXiv:1905.07553) argues the opposite direction on the first half —
multi-task learning "often leads to inferior overall performance as task objectives can
compete" — and its contribution is a framework for *assigning* tasks to several networks,
whose claimed advantage is "better accuracy using less inference time than not only a
single large multi-task neural network but also many single-task networks". It supports a
time-accuracy trade-off for task grouping; it does not support a general "hard sharing
matches or exceeds complex architectures" claim. This sentence is published CBIC prose
(`articles/CBIC___MTL/sections/method.tex:85` carries it verbatim), so it is an
errata-policy decision.

**UberNet and Sphere2Vec preprint records: CONFIRMED.** `kokkinos2016ubernet` is typed as
`@article{... journal = {arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.02132}}`; Crossref returns the version
of record, CVPR 2017, DOI 10.1109/cvpr.2017.579, pp. 5454–5463.
`mai2023sphere2vecgeneralpurposelocationrepresentation` is an `@misc` on arXiv:2306.17624;
Crossref returns ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing 202:439–462, DOI
10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2023.06.016. Both are metadata upgrades with no claim consequence.
The Standley PMLR volume/pages complaint is REFUTED as a defect: `apx_b_errata.tex:551`
records that the page range was dropped *because it was unverifiable*, which is the
fail-closed behaviour `AGENT_GUARDRAILS R2` requires, not a lapse.

**The scikit-learn row: REFUTED.** The review says "The 2011 scikit-learn paper cannot
support `StratifiedGroupKFold`, which was added in scikit-learn 1.0 in 2021." The citing
sentence at `2_fundamentals.tex:496-499` does not attribute the splitter to the paper: it
states the protocol in prose ("a grouped, stratified splitter keeps all of a user's
check-ins on one side of every fold") and cites the library. The chapter's own ledger
comment at `:573-574` records the ruling: "StratifiedGroupKFold is a scikit-learn v1.0/2021
feature; single-cite ruling (author) — 2011 paper for the library, splitter behavior
stated defensively in prose." Persona 05 reached the same verdict independently
(`05_citation_auditor_report.md:237`, SUPPORTED). This is a citation-style preference the
review has promoted to a claim-support failure. The author may still prefer a versioned
software citation; that is taste, and it is question 8 on the review's own list.

**Fixable without the author?** The two bibliographic upgrades (UberNet → CVPR 2017;
Sphere2Vec → ISPRS 2023) are mechanical and carry no claim. The Mikolov site has two
honest repairs: add the 1310.4546 entry and cite it for the negative-sampling clause, or
drop the two words "with *negative sampling*". Both touch published co-authored prose or
its bibliography, so both belong in the Appendix B trail; the bibliography half is inside
the dissertation's own global list, which `AGENT_GUARDRAILS R4` already puts under the
dissertation's control. **Standley is NEEDS-AUTHOR** (published prose, and the sentence is
a claim, not a typo).

### COD-009 — CoUrb translation and adaptation records lag the dissertation · **PARTLY**

**The single-seed overreach: REFUTED as it now stands.** The review says the dissertation
presents a code inference as a fact about the published execution.
`4_courb.tex:257` reads: "The released code of record pins a single random seed, so the
five folds constitute one repetition of the experiment rather than several, and the
reported standard deviations are the spread across folds at that seed." That is scoped to
the released code, which is exactly the scoping the review asks for. I verified the code
claim firsthand in `/Users/vitor/Desktop/mestrado/temp/tarik-new/PoiMtlNet_Novo/src/etl/mtl/create_fold.py`:
`random_state: int = 42` at :162, `torch.manual_seed(random_state)` at :180,
`np.random.seed(random_state)` at :181, and both splitters as
`StratifiedKFold(n_splits=k_splits, shuffle=True, random_state=random_state)` at :226 and
:229 with no `groups=` argument. The chapter's comment at :271 records "Deliberately NOT
claimed: that the published experiments were produced by this exact file."

**The ledger drift: CONFIRMED.** `src_utils/adaptation_ledgers/4_courb_ADAPTATION_LEDGER.md:3`
names the source of record as `articles/CoUrb_2026/src_en/`, the English translation
donor, rather than the published Portuguese article — which is the inversion the review
reports, and it matters because the published PT text is the artifact the errata policy is
answerable to. The count note at :39 says "EIGHT non-published sentences or blocks exist
in this chapter" and records that a previous count undercounted by five; at least one
later addition (the MTLnet spelling normalization, 26 sites, per `PENDENCIAS.md:274`) post-
dates it.

**The "no claim altered" tension: PARTLY, and the review points it at the wrong
chapter.** The sentence it describes is in Ch.5, not Ch.4: `5_mobiwac.tex:33` says "No
result, claim, or conclusion was altered; every departure from the submitted text is
recorded in the errata appendix." Ch.4's preface makes no such universal. Whether Ch.5's
universal survives Appendix B's claim-scope rows is a real question — Appendix B does list
wording substitutions that reduce claim strength — but the sentence's own second clause
points at the appendix that lists them, so a reader is not misled. Reconciling it is a
one-clause edit ("No result or numerical conclusion was altered; wording changes that
narrow a claim are listed in ...").

**Fixable without the author?** The ledger and inventory corrections are repository
records, outside `src/`, and are mechanical. The source-of-record inversion should be
fixed there. The Ch.5 universal is one clause and is `[NEEDS SIGN-OFF]`-class.

### COD-010 — capacity-matched control miscounted and over-compressed · **CONFIRMED**

The brief lists this as "partly addressed; verify". Verified: the count and the statistic
are both still wrong on the page. `6_conclusion.tex:116-118`, rendering on p77: "At
Alabama, across three training configurations and all twenty fitted models, the best of
them reaches 56.16 macro-F1, against 56.82 for the dedicated model at its own tuned width
and 64.51 for the joint model."

Against `docs/results/closing_data/capacity_matched_stl_cat/README.md`:

- :19 — "5 folds × seeds {0, 1, 7, 100} = **n=20 per arm**". Three arms are tabulated at
  :37-41 (bs2048 @ lr 0.0025; bs8192 @ lr 0.005; bs2048 @ lr 0.005), so the artifact holds
  20 fits per arm and 60 in total. "all twenty fitted models" across three configurations
  is arithmetically impossible as written.
- :39 — the best arm's row is `| bs2048 @ lr 0.0025 (**best**) | 20 | **56.16** | 1.89 |`.
  56.16 is that arm's **mean over 20 fits**, with SD 1.89, not "the best of them".

What makes this finding sharper than the review states: the chapter's own ledger comment
at `6_conclusion.tex:155-158` already knows about the missing spread — "the Alabama value
56.16 above still carries no spread; the same README gives std 1.89 for that arm. Adding it
would satisfy WRITING_LAW §3 for the whole paragraph, but that sentence is outside this
correction's scope, so it is left as approved." So the SD omission is a known, deferred
item; the count error and the "best of them" mis-description are not recorded anywhere and
are new here. Note also that the same paragraph reports California correctly ("69.88
macro-F1, standard deviation 0.26 over its twenty fitted models"), which makes the Alabama
sentence an internal inconsistency as well as a source mismatch.

**Fixable without the author?** Yes, mechanically, and it is the cleanest fix in this
audit. Every value is quoted, none computed: "At Alabama, across three training
configurations at twenty fitted models each, sixty in total, the best configuration
averages 56.16 macro-F1, standard deviation 1.89, against 56.82 for the dedicated model at
its own tuned width and 64.51 for the joint model." This changes no verdict — at 56.16 the
joint model still leads the capacity arm by 8.35 on the joint-best basis, as the chapter's
own comment at :126-129 records.

### COD-011 — privacy, ethics, licensing and governance absent · **RESOLVED**

Appendix E, "Data Ethics and Governance", renders on pp. 101–102 (listed in the ToC at
p12; included at `0_main.tex:404`). It covers every item the review asked for, and its
licence facts trace to the source of record:

- Provenance and licence: the Figshare deposit DOI `10.6084/m9.figshare.22126586.v2` under
  CC0, with two qualifications stated from the record itself (the dedication was applied by
  the depositor, not the collector; the named origin site now redirects elsewhere, so its
  terms could not be read). Massive-STEPS under Apache 2.0 on Hugging Face, with the
  Foursquare upstream noted as access-gated and its product terms explicitly recorded as
  not read. `src_utils/DATASET_LICENSING_FINDINGS.md` and the chapter's own comment record
  live re-verification on 2026-07-27, including `gated="auto"` for the Foursquare
  distribution against `gated=false` for the Massive-STEPS copy.
- Re-identification: "A user identifier in these files is a pseudonym and not a name, but a
  sequence of timestamped visits is still a description of one person's movements.
  Pseudonymity is not anonymity", cited to `luca2021mobilitysurvey`.
- What is *not* done: "this work adds no de-identification of its own. No coordinate is
  perturbed, rounded, generalized, or masked, and no formal privacy mechanism is applied",
  with the reason (the region target is itself spatial).
- Safeguards by restriction: the social-graph and user-profile files are declared unread,
  identifiers carried as opaque integers, no cross-collection linkage, and no
  redistribution (data directory excluded from version control).
- CEP/IRB: records the author's position that review was not required for secondary
  analysis of already-public data, and states plainly "It records no approval and no
  exemption, because none was sought and none is claimed" — which is exactly the
  do-not-invent discipline the review demanded.

The one item still open is the institutional determination itself, which the appendix
correctly declines to invent and flags for the file before deposit. That is COD-012
territory, not COD-011.

### COD-012 — both artifacts fail the UFV submission gate · **PARTLY**

**The bibliography font: RESOLVED, by measurement.** I sampled glyph font sizes through
the PDF text layer. Body page 30: 11.96 pt dominant. Bibliography page 81: **11.96 pt
dominant** (2,517 of 2,633 glyphs). The `\footnotesize` wrapper is gone;
`0_main.tex:393-395` records the removal and that it "Adds about two pages", which is
consistent with the 97→102 page change. Appendix B's tables measure 10.91 pt, which is a
`\small` table body and a different question (COD-017).

**Everything else: CONFIRMED and NEEDS-AUTHOR.** The defense build's p2 is the literal
placeholder — I rendered it and read it: "[Approval sheet placeholder — PPG signature-page
model is inserted here for the defense; signed version replaces it afterward]", from
`0_main.tex:165-171`. `\membrobancaA`, `\membrobancaB` and `\databanca` are placeholder
strings at `0_main.tex:126-128`. `\campus{Campus Florestal}` is set at :125, and the
comment at :122-124 correctly notes it renders nothing today because `\imprimircapa` is
called by neither build — so the cover is genuinely absent, as the review says. The font
is `newtxtext,newtxmath` (`0_main.tex:41`), a Times-metric-compatible face; whether the
secretariat accepts it against a rule naming "Times New Roman or Arial" is an external
determination and cannot be settled from the repository. Article 21 proof,
anti-plagiarism certificate, defense date and the AcademicoPG preview offset are all
external.

**Fixable without the author?** Only the bibliography half, and it is already done. The
rest is his and the secretariat's.

### COD-013 — AI disclosure ahead of the recorded approval state · **CONFIRMED**

The tension is real and the review's count is now low. `apx_c_ai_disclosure.tex:57-58`:
"No content entered the document from model memory, and the author reviewed and takes
responsibility for every word of the final text." A recursive grep of `src/` returns **31**
`[NEEDS SIGN-OFF]` markers, not 27, distributed as: `0_main.tex` 6, `6_conclusion.tex` 6,
`5_mobiwac.tex` 5, `apx_a_contributions.tex` 4, `apx_b_errata.tex` 3, `1_introduction.tex`
2, `2_fundamentals.tex` 2, and one each in `apx_c_ai_disclosure.tex`, `apx_d_ceiling.tex`,
`apx_e_ethics.tex`. Several sit on central claims: the withheld trunk attribution
(`6_conclusion.tex:110`), the capacity-control correction (:136), the rescoped ablation
clause (`5_mobiwac.tex:720`), and the whole of Appendices C and E. Appendix C's own header
comment carries a `[NEEDS SIGN-OFF: whole appendix ...]`, so the disclosure that asserts
completed author review is itself unapproved.

The model-naming sub-claim also holds: the appendix says "eighteen-reviewer panel, each
reviewer a separate agent (Claude Opus family)" while `CLAUDE.md` §1 records the exact
model the v1 suite ran on and the reason for the deviation. Naming what is verifiable is
the review's correct recommendation.

**Fixable without the author?** Structurally no: the whole finding is "the text claims an
approval that has not happened", and only the author can either grant the approval or
authorize the weaker wording. What *is* mechanical is producing the list — the 31 marker
sites with file and line — so he can work through them. **NEEDS-AUTHOR.**

### COD-014 — "ceiling" and the Markov-floor explanation · **RESOLVED**

**The renaming is complete.** Zero occurrences of "label-only ceiling", "autocorrelation
ceiling", or "what the past itself allows" in either PDF. "label-history benchmark"
appears on pp. 8, 12, 66, 98, 99, 100. Appendix D is titled "A Label-History Benchmark for
the Next-Category Task" (`apx_d_ceiling.tex:13`; the filename still says `ceiling`, which
is harmless). The not-an-upper-bound statement is in the running text where the review
asked for it, `5_mobiwac.tex:376`: "It is not an upper bound on what a model may score.
The four predictors are a specified set, and a better predictor of the same restricted
information could exceed them." `GLOSSARY.md` §2 carries both the new entry and a
retirement row for the old name that forbids reintroducing it, and it separates the
benchmark from the **clean reference encoder** (0.4090 standardized / 0.4074 raw at
Florida) that the screen actually gates on — a distinction the review did not make and
which matters, since the two were conflated in the internal record.

**The Markov paragraph is rewritten and no longer carries a common causal story.** On p73:
"Neither fact establishes why the floor lies above the three systems, and we do not claim a
single explanation." The protocol asymmetry is now stated system by system — HMT-GRN on the
same data, folds and initialization; STAN on the same folds but its own embeddings and
sequences; the ReHDM reference under its own published protocol, "so its cell is not
measured on our windows or folds at all" — and the region-native/place-level error the
review caught is gone. The counts render as the review verified them (floor above HMT-GRN
at six of six, ReHDM at three, STAN at four).

**One number in this paragraph changed after the review and is worth recording as
correct.** The Alabama revisit share is now "the target region is the last visited region
in 32.1 percent of windows". It quotes
`docs/results/closing_data/markov_floor_stride1/alabama.json`, key
`aggregate.markov_1step_region.acc1_mean` = 0.32064040033191976 (SD 0.01690965826249736),
which is the same artifact, the same 96,326 stride-1 windows and the same folds as the
62.26 Acc@10 floor in the sentence before it. The superseded 22.4 percent figure was a
place-level rate on non-overlapping windows and did not support the region-level sentence
it was attached to. The review saw the wrong number and did not catch it; the fact gate
did (`_specialists_v2/FACT_GATE_v3.md` B-1).

### COD-015 — cross-chapter task, data and reference-point seams · **PARTLY**

Six sub-claims. Four hold — (a) the Ch.3 preface clause, (c) the Gowalla vintage, (d) the
unused metric promises, (f) the gradient scope in Ch.6 — and two do not: (b) the
next-POI bridge and (e) the cross-reference targets.

**(a) Ch.3 preface says Chapters 4–5 revise through representation rather than
architecture, although Ch.5 changes topology and task pair — HOLDS, weakly.**
`3_cbic.tex:23-24` reads "Chapters 4 and 5 revise that verdict by changing the input
representation rather than the architecture." Ch.5 does change the topology
(cross-attention replacing shared hidden layers) and the task pair. The frame elsewhere is
careful about this: `1_introduction.tex:124-130` states both changes explicitly, and
`1_introduction.tex:135` says "The task pair therefore evolved across the three studies".
So the defect is a single unqualified preface clause against a frame that gets it right
everywhere else.

**(b) "Next-POI" defined as exact-place prediction in a chapter that predicts next
category — REFUTED.** Both paper chapters carry an explicit bridge. `3_cbic.tex:28-31`:
"the term ``Next-POI Prediction'' as used in the reproduced article denotes the frame's
*next category* task, that is, predicting the category of the next visited place, not the
exact place itself". `4_courb.tex:18` carries the same sentence. `3_cbic.tex:53` defines
the task as "Predicting the category of the next POI a user will visit". Appendix B has a
row for the one related-work definition that did read as exact-place. This is closed.

**(c) Gowalla vintage 2009–2010 versus 2009–2011 — HOLDS as an inconsistency, but it is
not a "distinct extraction bases" problem.** `4_courb.tex:425` (published prose) says
"collected between February 2009 and October 2010"; `6_conclusion.tex:196` (frame prose)
says "collected between 2009 and 2011". Both cite the same collection. One of the two is
wrong and the frame is the one the dissertation controls.

**(d) Ch.2 promises MRR and relative multi-task performance change, neither of which
appears — HOLDS.** `2_fundamentals.tex:471` says Acc@10 "says nothing about the
probability mass placed on the true region, which is why mean reciprocal rank accompanies
it where the joint comparison needs a rank-sensitive figure", and :476-478 introduces "the
relative multi-task performance change" citing `maninis2019attentive`. Both phrases render
on p24 and nowhere else: "reciprocal rank" appears on p24 only, "relative multi-task" on
p24 only, and "MRR" on no page at all. Neither quantity is reported in any results chapter.

**(e) The random-region and checkpoint-selection cross-references do not point to sections
that define those claims — REFUTED as far as it can be checked.** Both builds report zero
undefined references (`build/main.log`, and `check.sh`'s flattened-log sweep returns OK).
The random-region reference at `5_mobiwac.tex:78` points to
`sec:mobiwac:results-part2`, where the random top-ten figure is given; the checkpoint
pointer at `:880` points to `sec:mobiwac:setup-windows`, and the joint-best convention is
defined at `:523` in that section's neighbourhood. If the review means a semantic rather
than a syntactic mismatch, it did not name which reference, and I could not reproduce one.

**(f) Gradient scope is four Gowalla states, not "three of six" — HOLDS in Ch.6 only, and
this is NUM-3.** Ch.5 is fixed: `:204-208` now reads "four seeds each on four Gowalla
states: Alabama, Arizona and Florida, which are three of the five United States datasets
reported here, and Georgia, which this dissertation does not otherwise use, per-dataset
means within ±0.003". `6_conclusion.tex:176-178` still reads "averaged +0.001 over four
seeds on three of the six datasets". The source is
`docs/results/mtl_improvement/R0_matched_metric_bar.json`, whose `states` object has
exactly four keys — `alabama`, `arizona`, `georgia`, `florida` — each with seeds 0/1/7/100,
and `scripts/mtl_improvement/plot_grad_cosine.py:19-24` names the same four in its style map. So Ch.5
and Ch.6 now disagree with each other on the same measurement.

**Fixable without the author?** (c), (d) and (f) are. (f) is a scope correction with the
Ch.5 sentence available as the model to copy, and it removes an internal contradiction.
(c) is picking which vintage is right for the frame sentence and matching Ch.4's published
range. (d) is either deleting two promises or reporting the two metrics; deleting is the
honest cheap option since neither quantity exists in any result file I found. (a) is one
preface clause and is `[NEEDS SIGN-OFF]`-class because it characterizes the arc.

### COD-016 — targeted language and readability pass · **PARTLY**

**The `3_cbic.tex:340` "unrecoverable sentence": REFUTED as stated, and the review
mislocated it.** The quoted words are at :340 (PDF p39), inside published CBIC prose:
"Also, it is important to notice that since we have an unbalanced result for the MTL and
single, this could lead to the worse of other results." It is awkward English, not
unrecoverable: read against the table it introduces, it says that because MTL and
single-task lead in different categories, a per-category comparison can look worse than
the aggregate picture. That the meaning is recoverable does not make the sentence good —
it should be clarified — but "meaning is not recoverable without author clarification"
overstates it, and it is published co-authored prose, so a rewrite is an errata decision.

**The high-burden passages: CONFIRMED by measurement.** The abstract's result sentence is
**114 words** (measured on the `0_main.tex` abstract body with macros stripped) against a
7-to-53-word range for its neighbours, so it is more than double the next-longest sentence
in the same paragraph. The four-channel integrity paragraph is one block at
`5_mobiwac.tex:376` rendering across pp. 66–67; persona 15 measured it at 546 unbroken
words and rated it Critical, persona 01 put it in its top three, and persona 09
independently called the same paragraph the round's strongest work and warned against
editing its defenses away. `_review_v2/README.md` records that disagreement and resolves it
correctly: persona 15's recommendation is break-insertion with **zero words changed**,
which does not touch what 09 is protecting. That is the right reading and this audit
concurs.

**The style-audit density claim: REFUTED as a current failure.** `check.sh` runs the
WRITING_LAW §4 banned-word sweep, the contraction sweep, the em-dash sweep and the
codename sweep over all chapters and returns OK on each. The only hits are in the
verdict-verb sweep, which is explicitly labelled "crude sweep, review hits" and does not
set the failure flag; I read all five and every one is legitimate (three are "Pareto" in
optimization contexts at `3_cbic.tex:108, 118, 234`, two are the word "wins" inside
Appendix B rows that *quote* the published text being corrected).

**Fixable without the author?** Break-insertion in the integrity paragraph is
zero-word-change and safe. The abstract sentence split is a rewrite of the document's most
load-bearing paragraph and is `[NEEDS SIGN-OFF]`-class. `3_cbic.tex:340` is
**NEEDS-AUTHOR** (published prose).

### COD-017 — visual and typographic inconsistencies · **PARTLY**

**The oversized Appendix B float: CONFIRMED, unchanged.** `build/main.log:1932` and
`build/main_final.log:1916` both carry `LaTeX Warning: Float too large for page by
21.55853pt on input line 556`, which is the `\end{table}` of the bibliography-errata table
at `apx_b_errata.tex:563`. I rendered the page: defense p96 holds fourteen errata rows and
the table body runs to the bottom rule with no visible clipping, so this is a spacing
warning rather than lost content, but the warning is real and both builds report it.

**Small in-figure labels: CONFIRMED by measurement.** Sampling glyph sizes on every page
carrying a numbered figure:

| page | figure content | smallest label sizes | glyphs below 9 pt |
|---|---|---|---|
| p35 | Ch.3 architecture | 9.96 | 0 |
| p48 | Ch.4 architecture | 8.77 | 9 |
| p53 | Ch.4 spatial panels | 9.96 | 0 |
| **p62** | Ch.5 diagram | **6.97 / 7.27** | 389 |
| **p64** | Ch.5 model diagram | **6.97 / 7.27** | 351 |
| p70 | Ch.5 separability | 8.50 / 8.97 | 111 |
| p72 | Ch.5 deltas | 8.00 / 9.00 | 48 |

Against a 11.96 pt body, 6.97 pt is 58 percent of body size. The review named pp. 35, 48,
62 and 64 in the old pagination and its instinct was right, though on the current build the
worst offenders are the two Ch.5 diagrams, not the Ch.3/Ch.4 ones.

**The Portuguese figure labels: RESOLVED.** Persona 18's blocker (Figure 2 labelled
`Encoder Espacial`, `Coordenadas (lat, lon)`, etc. under an English caption) is gone: those
strings appear on no page of the current build. The only Portuguese on a Ch.4 page is the
published paper's own title inside the preface, which is correct.

**The near-blank p4 with orphaned Resumo keywords: CONFIRMED.** I rendered it: p4 carries
three keyword lines ("previsão da próxima categoria / previsão da próxima região /
representação em nível de check-in") and nothing else.

**Fixable without the author?** All three are, and all three are pure production work: the
float split or row-padding reduction, regenerating the two Ch.5 diagrams at larger label
size, and keeping the keyword block with its Resumo. The review's own caution applies and
is correct — do not do the float reflow until the prose stops moving, because pagination
will shift.

### COD-018 — governance files and automated gates no longer describe the artifact · **PARTLY**

**Stale page counts: CONFIRMED.** Current builds are 102 and 97 pages. `CLAUDE.md:28-29`
says 89 and 84; `PLAN.md:17-18` says 89 and 84; `HANDOFF_v1.md:71` and `:130` say 89 and
84; `PENDENCIAS.md:432-433` says 94/89. Four documents, three different stale pairs. The
review's own reported pair (97/92) is now stale too, which is itself evidence of how fast
this drifts.

**Appendix A per-role CoUrb credit: CONFIRMED absent.** The review raises this in its
chapter-by-chapter section rather than in COD-018, but it belongs to the same class.
`apx_a_contributions.tex` describes the platform and the ETL pipeline, and at :75-77 it
correctly narrows a previously false claim about protocol uniformity, but it states no
per-role contribution for CoUrb (conceptualization, software, experiments, analysis,
visualization, writing). Ch.4's preface (:18) carries the roles it does state: second
author, presenter, author of the baseline MTLnet. Filling the rest is a fact only the
author holds. **NEEDS-AUTHOR.**

**The trapped-prose checker returning success despite live failures: RESOLVED.** See
COD-001. The detector now fails closed on its own fixtures before its document verdict is
trusted, and `check.sh:59-71` carries the comment explaining why the fixture step exists
and why it captures the exit status rather than piping it.

**The `pypdfium2` dependency: RESOLVED.** `build.sh:100-106` wraps the import in
`try/except` and degrades to `low = f"unmeasured({exc.__class__.__name__})"` rather than
failing. `check.sh` does not import it at all. `make check` runs clean end to end: I ran
`bash check.sh` and it exits 0.

**Locale-fragile log scanning: RESOLVED in the way that matters.** `check.sh:36` flattens
the log with `tr -d '\n'` before matching and reads the `.blg` separately, with a comment
recording that the previous line-anchored grep let four undefined citations ship because
LaTeX wraps warnings at 79 columns. The regexes match LaTeX's own English warning strings,
which is not locale-dependent for this toolchain.

**The Ch.5 adaptation ledger claim: not audited in depth.** I read
`5_mobiwac_ADAPTATION_LEDGER.md`'s date (2026-07-23) against the chapter's mtime
(2026-07-27 07:43) and the several corrections applied since, so the review's "says every
departure is recorded while omitting multiple recent additions" is consistent with the
timestamps. I did not enumerate the omissions, so I record this as **plausible and
unverified in detail** rather than confirmed.

**Fixable without the author?** The page counts and the ledger synchronization are, and
they are outside `src/`. Appendix A's roles are not.

## 3 · The "Numerical corrections required" table (`codex_reviewer.md:991-1004`)

Rows 1, 2, 6 and 8 duplicate COD-010 and COD-014 and are cross-referenced rather than
re-argued. The four rows that carry independent content:

### NUM-3 — gradient scope "three of six" → four Gowalla states · **PARTLY**

Corrected in Ch.5, uncorrected in Ch.6. Full evidence under COD-015(f). The review's
required correction is right and the fix is now a copy of the Ch.5 sentence's scope clause
into `6_conclusion.tex:177`. **Fixable without the author.**

### NUM-4 — HGI example 0.74 → 0.82 basis not fully specified · **CONFIRMED, and already carrying a `[VERIFY]`**

`2_fundamentals.tex:170-173`: "the cross-region edge weight of their Equation 2, set to 0.4
for the dense Chinese cities they study, was raised to 0.7 for the sparser United States
state datasets used here, a change under which the category F1 on Alabama, over five folds,
rose monotonically from 0.74 to 0.82 across the swept values."

The source, `research/embeddings/hgi/README.md:544-551`, is a four-row sweep at 5 folds ×
50 epochs: 0.4 → 0.7388 ± 0.0205, 0.5 → 0.7678 ± 0.0211, 0.6 → 0.7944 ± 0.0186, 0.7 →
0.8186 ± 0.0123. So the endpoints are correct to two decimals and the monotonicity claim is
true on all four rows, but both spreads are dropped, which `WRITING_LAW §3` requires
("fold-std or CI wherever a mean appears in a claim"). The chapter already carries
`% [VERIFY: averaging convention of the swept "Cat F1"]` at :174 with the full provenance
chain, so this is a known open flag, not an undiscovered error. The same README line 552-554
also says "Next F1 is effectively flat across the sweep", which is the context the review's
chapter-by-chapter section separately asks for.

**Fixable without the author?** The spreads can be added by quotation (0.7388 ± 0.0205 to
0.8186 ± 0.0123), which closes the `WRITING_LAW §3` half. The averaging-convention question
in the `[VERIFY]` flag is a question about how that README computed "Cat F1" and is
**NEEDS-AUTHOR**.

### NUM-5 — "Arizona rounding: table/raw precision differs by 0.01 in one trace" · **REFUTED as stated**

Every Arizona figure the document prints is on one basis, the joint-best convention, and
each traces exactly:

| document site | value | source |
|---|---|---|
| `5_mobiwac.tex:599` (Table, p71) | cat 56.43 dedicated / **65.79** joint | `JOINT_BEST_RESULTS.md:33` AZ joint-best 65.79 ±0.02 |
| `5_mobiwac.tex:636` (p71) | Δcat range top **+9.35** | `JOINT_BEST_RESULTS.md:56` AZ Δcat deploy **+9.35** |
| `5_mobiwac.tex:617` (Table, p71) | reg **59.46** dedicated and joint | `JOINT_BEST_RESULTS.md:43` AZ 59.46 dedicated, 59.46 ±0.04 joint-best |
| `5_mobiwac.tex:661` (p71) | AZ TOST **0.00**; −0.08 to +0.07 | same row, Δreg deploy −0.00 |

The 0.01 wobble the artifact discusses is explicitly on the **diagnostic-best** basis:
`JOINT_BEST_RESULTS.md:60-62` records that "+9.40 is the paper/board value (from the rounded
65.83 MTL cell)" while the full-precision diagnostic Δ is +9.41. Neither 9.40 nor 9.41
appears anywhere in either PDF; I searched both. The document does not straddle the two
bases, which is the very thing `AGENT_GUARDRAILS N5` forbids, and the chapter's own comment
at `:528-534` documents the ruling that put it on one basis. **Nothing to fix.** If the
review means the rounding *convention* should be stated once, that is a reasonable style
request, not a numerical correction.

### NUM-7 — CoUrb 20.2–22.0 "reads as a deployable fixed encoder" · **PARTLY**

**The convention is disclosed in Ch.4 and in Appendix B, at every site.** `4_courb.tex:40`,
`:318` and `:419` each carry "considering the better of the two spatial encoders in each
combination". `apx_b_errata.tex:286-290` records the correction from the published "20 to
24 percentage points" to the audited 20.2 to 22.0, and calls the per-cell clause "the
disclosure the audit requires".

I verified the arithmetic from the printed table (`4_courb.tex:329-351`), which is the only
computation in this audit and is reported as such:

| state | mean gain, SIREN only | mean gain, Sphere2Vec-M only | mean gain, per-cell best |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Florida | 20.09 | 20.10 | 20.24 |
| California | 20.86 | 20.70 | 20.91 |
| Texas | 17.89 | 21.98 | 21.98 |

So the range 20.2 to 22.0 is the per-cell-best envelope, and the review is right that it is
an envelope: at Texas a single fixed encoder choice would give either 17.89 or 21.98, and
the 20.2 lower end depends on Florida's best-of-two. I also confirmed the "all 21
combinations" universal holds on the printed values (21 of 21 rows have both variants above
MTLnet), which is what `4_courb.tex:305-316`'s ledger comment claims.

**Not disclosed in the frame.** `1_introduction.tex:113` ("Category performance rose sharply
at every state tested") and `6_conclusion.tex:46` ("raised category macro-F1 by 20.2 to 22.0
percentage points across the three states tested") carry the number and the range without
the per-cell clause. The word "oracle" appears nowhere in either PDF.

**Fixable without the author?** The Ch.6 site can carry the same clause Ch.4 already uses,
by quotation, with no new number. Whether to call it an "oracle envelope" is a wording
choice: `GLOSSARY.md` does not register "oracle", and the fail-closed maintenance rule says
a term not in the registry may not be used, so that specific word needs an author-approved
glossary entry first. This is a genuine constraint the review could not have known.

---

## 4 · The review's own "Reviewer Agreements and Disagreements" (`:1127-1192`)

The review adjudicates six disputes; §4.1 to §4.6 below take them in its own order, and
§4.7 adds a seventh dispute it should have adjudicated and did not. I assessed each on the
evidence available to the review at its date and
on the evidence now.

### 4.1 "Is Chapter 3 direct target leakage?" — **SOUND, and the best work in the review**

It refuses two personas' stronger reading and grounds the refusal in code: Ch.3's DGI path
replaces a node's own one-hot with the neighbours' mean before the GAT, so direct
self-label lookup is not confirmed. I verified this independently:
`research/embeddings/dgi/preprocess.py:115` builds `pd.get_dummies(self.pois['category'])`,
`:130` sets each node's feature to `self.embedding_array.iloc[neighbors].mean(axis=0)`, and
`research/embeddings/dgi/dgi.py:56` feeds `embedding_array_test` (the neighbour-mean array) as `data.x` while
`embedding_array` (the raw one-hot) goes in as a separate field. The adjudication's
disposition — "transductive, label-derived spatial homophily/label propagation", major scope
uncertainty rather than confirmed deterministic lookup — is the correct characterization and
it matches the author's own reading at `PENDENCIAS.md:146`. Note the caveat the
adjudication does not state: an isolated node gets `[0]*7`, and a node whose neighbours
share its category gets a vector that is nearly its own one-hot, so the propagation is
weaker protection at high homophily than the framing implies.

### 4.2 "Does the future-edge channel invalidate Chapter 5?" — **SOUND on epistemics, stale on the document**

"The correct status is unverified... may not describe it as proven clean" is right, and it
is the disposition the chapter itself takes. Where the adjudication is now stale is the
implication that the document still describes it as clean: `5_mobiwac.tex:391` states all
three limits and volunteers the counter-example. The one surviving global word is at
`1_introduction.tex:158`, which the adjudication does not name. So: sound reasoning, wrong
target.

### 4.3 "Does 'MTL help'?" — **SOUND**

The operational/causal split is the right frame, the freeze-control and Florida-null
evidence is correctly read, and "the dissertation must define which sense it claims" is the
right ask. It is also 90 percent satisfied already: `5_mobiwac.tex:703-714` and
`6_conclusion.tex:95-103` make the operational claim and withhold the causal one
explicitly. The residual is the single contradicting sentence at `:872` (COD-004), which
this adjudication and COD-004 both identify.

### 4.4 "Does selection bias cancel in paired differences?" — **SOUND**

"Shared folds and a wider dedicated-model search provide some protection and can make the
comparison conservative in some directions. Different epoch selectors and use of the
reporting fold for selection prevent a proof of exact cancellation." That is exactly what
`5_mobiwac.tex:880` says, including the closing "It does not follow that the bias cancels
exactly." The adjudication agrees with the document and both are right; it should have said
so rather than framing it as an open dispute.

### 4.5 "Is the new label-only analysis a ceiling?" — **SOUND, and already actioned**

"No. It is the best observed result among four specified history-only predictors" is
correct and is now the document's own wording. The adjudication credits "the adversarial
change gate" for rejecting the upper-bound terminology, which is accurate — the rename
happened on 2026-07-27 by author decision and is registered in `GLOSSARY.md` §2.

### 4.6 "Are TeX Gyre Termes and the standalone Fundamentals chapter acceptable?" — **SOUND, with one factual slip**

"They may be accepted in practice or by precedent, but the repository's current
institutional evidence does not establish that acceptance. These are external
advisor/Comissão/secretariat decisions, not facts to infer." Correct, and correctly
refuses to infer. The slip is the font's identity: `0_main.tex:41` loads
`newtxtext,newtxmath`, not TeX Gyre Termes. The two are related Times-metric-compatible
families and the compliance question is identical, but a submission conversation should name
the package that is actually loaded.

### 4.7 One adjudication the section should have made and did not

The `_review_v2` personas record a disagreement the codex review passes over entirely:
persona 09 calls the four-channel integrity paragraph the round's strongest work and warns
against editing its defenses away, while personas 15 and 01 call the same paragraph the
document's worst readability failure. `_review_v2/README.md` resolves it (break-insertion,
zero words changed). The codex review reproduces persona 15's side as COD-016 and persona
09's side as its own COD-003 recommendation, in different sections, without noticing that
they are about the same 546 words. Anyone acting on COD-016 without reading COD-003 could
delete the disclosures COD-003 depends on.

---

## 5 · Where codex and the v2 personas overlap or disagree

The brief flags that several COD items restate persona findings already fixed. They do, and
the mapping matters because the persona reports carry the measurements the codex review
paraphrases.

| COD item | Persona origin | Status of the overlap |
|---|---|---|
| COD-001 | 02, 15, 16 (16 found the seventh case on 2026-07-27) | Fixed after the personas; codex reports the pre-fix state |
| COD-002 | 11 (`11_poi_mobility_expert_report.md:33-41` carries the five-state purity table; the codex text reproduces its argument) | Determinism measured by 11 and re-measured here; disclosure still open |
| COD-003 | 09, 10, 11 | Ch.5 limits added in response to the personas; codex does not credit them |
| COD-004 | 10 (BLOCKER) | Applied 2026-07-27 per `PENDENCIAS.md:191-215`; the `:872` residue is new and neither the personas nor codex isolate it |
| COD-005 | 10 (F-02) | Author ruled on PCGrad at `PENDENCIAS.md:180-184`; codex re-raises a settled ruling |
| COD-008 | 05 | Codex adds the Mikolov and Standley findings, which persona 05 did **not** report; persona 05 explicitly cleared the scikit-learn site that codex flags. **Genuine disagreement, and codex is right on two of three** |
| COD-014 | 06, 11, 14 | Applied; the Markov paragraph rewrite is at `PENDENCIAS.md:217-228` |
| COD-017 | 18 | Portuguese labels fixed; float and small labels remain |
| NUM-4 | 06 | Same `[VERIFY]` flag |
| Markov 22.4 percent | `FACT_GATE_v3.md` B-1 | Codex quotes the superseded number without flagging it; the fact gate caught it and it is now 32.1 percent |

**The two places where codex and the personas genuinely disagree, both worth the author's
attention:**

1. **The scikit-learn citation.** Persona 05 audited the site and marked it SUPPORTED with
   a reason; codex marks it a confirmed claim-support failure. On the evidence, persona 05
   is right about what the sentence claims and codex is right that a versioned software
   citation would be cleaner. This is a style question wearing a fact-gate costume.
2. **The integrity paragraph.** Persona 09 protects it, personas 15 and 01 want it broken
   up, codex asks for both in separate findings. Resolve as `_review_v2/README.md` does:
   insert breaks, change no words.

**One thing codex found that no persona did.** The capacity-control count error (COD-010) is
codex's own, and it is a real number defect in frame prose that four number-focused
reviewers missed. It deserves credit.

---

## 6 · Fixable without the author

Ordered by value. Every item names its site, its source, and what the corrected text
asserts. None introduces a number that is not quoted from a committed artifact, and none
strengthens a claim. Items marked `[sign-off]` are mechanically safe but touch a claim,
a protocol paragraph, or reproduced article prose, so under `AGENT_GUARDRAILS C2` they
should land as proposals rather than silent edits.

1. ~~**COD-010 / NUM-1 / NUM-2 — the capacity-control sentence.**~~ **DONE at 08:53 by
   another hand**, while this audit was being written. `6_conclusion.tex:116-118` now reads
   "the widened model was fitted under three training configurations, twenty models each and
   sixty in total, and the strongest configuration averages 56.16 macro-F1, standard
   deviation 1.89". That is the count, the statistic and the spread, all three, against
   `docs/results/closing_data/capacity_matched_stl_cat/README.md:19,:39`. No verdict moved.
   Verify the deferred-spread note at `6_conclusion.tex:155-158` is retired, since it now
   describes a condition that no longer holds.
2. **NUM-3 / COD-015(f) — the gradient scope in Ch.6.** `6_conclusion.tex:177`. "three of
   the six datasets" → four Gowalla states, three of the five United States datasets
   reported plus Georgia, which the dissertation does not otherwise use. Copy the scope
   clause already approved at `5_mobiwac.tex:204-208`. Source
   `docs/results/mtl_improvement/R0_matched_metric_bar.json` (`states`: alabama, arizona,
   georgia, florida). Removes a Ch.5-versus-Ch.6 contradiction.
3. **COD-008 — two bibliography records to their versions of record.**
   `kokkinos2016ubernet` → CVPR 2017, DOI 10.1109/cvpr.2017.579, pp. 5454–5463;
   `mai2023sphere2vec...` → ISPRS J. Photogramm. Remote Sens. 202:439–462, DOI
   10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2023.06.016. Both verified against Crossref this session. Add
   Appendix B rows.
4. ~~**COD-008 — the Mikolov negative-sampling site.**~~ **DONE at 08:54 by another hand.**
   `4_courb.tex:208` now cites `mikolov2013word2vec,mikolov2013negsampling`; the new entry
   is at `references.bib:685`; `apx_b_errata.tex` carries a row stating that
   arXiv:1301.3781 "introduces skip-gram but not negative sampling" and that
   arXiv:1310.4546 was added alongside it. This is the first of the two repairs I named and
   it is the better one, since the citing sentence claims both methods.
5. **COD-017 — the two Ch.5 diagrams.** Regenerate pp. 62 and 64 with labels at 9 to 10 pt;
   they currently carry 389 and 351 glyphs at 6.97/7.27 pt against a 11.96 pt body.
6. **COD-017 — the Appendix B float and the Resumo keywords.** Split the
   bibliography-errata table at `apx_b_errata.tex:563` or reduce row padding to clear the
   21.55853 pt warning both logs report; keep the three keyword lines with the Resumo so
   p4 is not a near-blank page. Do this last, after the prose stops moving.
7. **COD-015(d) — the two unused metric promises.** `2_fundamentals.tex:471` (mean
   reciprocal rank) and `:476-478` (relative multi-task performance change). Neither
   quantity is reported anywhere; both phrases render on p24 alone. Delete the promises.
   `[sign-off]` — deleting a metric definition is a scope change to the Fundamentals
   chapter.
8. **COD-015(c) — the Gowalla vintage in the frame.** `6_conclusion.tex:196` says
   "2009 and 2011"; Ch.4's published prose at `:425` says "February 2009 and October 2010".
   Match the frame to the published range.
9. **NUM-4 — the HGI sweep spreads.** `2_fundamentals.tex:172`. Quote 0.7388 ± 0.0205 to
   0.8186 ± 0.0123 from `research/embeddings/hgi/README.md:546-551`, satisfying
   `WRITING_LAW §3`. The `[VERIFY]` flag on the averaging convention stays.
10. **COD-016 — break the integrity paragraph.** `5_mobiwac.tex:376`. Insert paragraph
    breaks at the four grounds, changing no words. This is the resolution
    `_review_v2/README.md` already reached between personas 09 and 15.
11. **COD-004 — the trunk attribution.** `5_mobiwac.tex:872`. Remove the component
    attribution and keep the operational statement. `[sign-off]` — highest-value single
    sentence in this list; it removes a contradiction with `:713` one page earlier, and it
    needs an Appendix B row because it is interpretive prose in a re-typeset chapter.
12. **COD-003 — the one global leakage word.** `1_introduction.tex:158`. "a
    leakage-guarded statistical protocol" → "a user-disjoint statistical protocol".
    `[sign-off]` — it is a specific-objective statement.
13. **COD-006 — two statistical clauses.** `5_mobiwac.tex:418`. "before any result was
    read" → "before the final result board was read" (the protocol's own header says
    "BEFORE the board unblinds", and its §3.2 pins the margin using a two-seed Florida
    gap); "The equivalence is well powered" → a statement of observed interval precision
    conditional on the fixed split, using the 0.01-to-0.18 figure already in the sentence.
    `[sign-off]` — this is the paragraph the Ch.5 verdict rests on.
14. **COD-005 — the balancer screen's scope.** `5_mobiwac.tex:185`. Add the scope the audit
    records: registry defaults, seed 0, Alabama and Florida
    (`docs/results/mtl_improvement/T4_audit_and_verdict.md:8-17`). `[sign-off]` — it qualifies a result claim.
15. **COD-009 / COD-018 — repository records, all outside `src/`.** Page counts in
    `CLAUDE.md:28-29`, `PLAN.md:17-18`, `HANDOFF_v1.md:71,:130`, `PENDENCIAS.md:432-433`
    → 102/97. `4_courb_ADAPTATION_LEDGER.md:3` source of record → the published Portuguese
    article, with the English translation named as the donor. Refresh the Ch.4 and Ch.5
    ledger inventories against the current chapters.

## 7 · Needs the author

1. **COD-002 — the Ch.4 static-shortcut disclosure.** He has already authorized an appendix
   (`PENDENCIAS.md:145-150`) and identified the co-author courtesy notice as a
   precondition. Outstanding: send the notice to Tarik S. Paiva; approve the appendix text;
   approve the one-clause scoping of `1_introduction.tex:114` and a Ch.6 §6.2 limitation
   bullet. This is the single largest open item in the document.
2. **COD-003 — whether to run the exact-lineage nonlinear future-edge test.** A research
   decision, not an edit. If the answer is no, Ch.5's current wording is already the
   conditional form the review's own option 2 describes, and only item 12 above is needed.
3. **COD-005 — the Nash-MTL cost claim: report or correct?** Currently preserved and named
   in Appendix B, per his prior REPORTED-NOT-CORRECTED ruling; `PENDENCIAS.md:250` asks
   whether to move it into the errata table. Also `4_courb.tex:120`'s unconditional
   "ensures that the update is beneficial for all tasks".
4. **COD-005 — PCGrad.** Already decided (`PENDENCIAS.md:180-184`: keep it named). Recorded
   here so nobody reopens it. His stated reason is defensible; adding the screen's scope
   (item 14) is what makes it fully honest.
5. **COD-007 — the Ch.3 and Ch.4 records.** Can the original CBIC split axis, seed count,
   tuning budget and checkpoint rule be recovered? Can the published CoUrb execution seed
   be established? If not, the chapters should be marked historical descriptive evidence,
   which the frame already half does at `2_fundamentals.tex:496-500`.
6. **COD-008 — the Standley sentence.** `3_cbic.tex:210` is published prose whose claim the
   cited paper does not support. Errata-policy decision: narrow it in the chapter with an
   Appendix B row, or preserve and name it as with the Nash cost claim.
7. **COD-011 / COD-012 — the institutional facts.** CEP/IRB determination if the program
   requires one; cover; approval sheet; committee names; defense date; Article 21
   comprovante; anti-plagiarism certificate; the font ruling (note that the loaded package
   is `newtxtext/newtxmath`, not TeX Gyre Termes); the AcademicoPG preview offset.
8. **COD-013 — the 31 `[NEEDS SIGN-OFF]` markers.** Either work through them before
   circulation or weaken Appendix C to the true current state. Distribution: `0_main.tex`
   6, `6_conclusion.tex` 6, `5_mobiwac.tex` 5, `apx_a_contributions.tex` 4,
   `apx_b_errata.tex` 3, `1_introduction.tex` 2, `2_fundamentals.tex` 2, and one each in
   Appendices C, D and E. Also: name the AI model versions that are independently
   verifiable, since the appendix currently says "Claude Opus family".
9. **COD-015(a) — the Ch.3 preface clause.** "Chapters 4 and 5 revise that verdict by
   changing the input representation rather than the architecture" understates Ch.5's
   topology and task-pair changes, which the introduction states correctly at :124-130.
   Rewording it is an arc characterization.
10. **COD-016 — `3_cbic.tex:340`.** The awkward published sentence about the unbalanced
    MTL/single result. My reading is that it means a per-category comparison can look worse
    than the aggregate, but confirming the intent and authorizing a clarification is his.
11. **COD-018 — Appendix A's CoUrb roles.** Concrete contributions in conceptualization,
    software, experiments, analysis, visualization and writing. Only he holds these facts.
12. **NUM-7 — whether to call the CoUrb per-cell envelope an "oracle."** The word is not in
    `GLOSSARY.md`, and the registry's fail-closed rule blocks its use until he approves an
    entry. The convention itself can be stated in Ch.6 without the word (item list above).

## 8 · Two notes on how to read the review

**It is a competent review of a document that no longer exists.** Its executive summary
leads with four gate failures, of which one (COD-001) is fixed, one (COD-011) is fixed, one
(COD-002) is half-fixed in the sense that the measurement exists and the disclosure does
not, and one (COD-012) is fixed on the item the repository controls and open on the items it
does not. Its severity ordering was right at its date. Acting on its statuses today would
mean re-doing four rounds of finished work.

**Its failure mode is asserting the document's state from the source rather than the
render.** Several findings quote a source line and infer what the reader sees; where the
correction round changed the rendered page and not the reviewer's copy, the finding is
stale. Its own closing recommendation anticipates this — "A final reviewer pass should
verify the rendered artifact, not only source diffs and logs" — and that is the right
instruction. Every verdict in this file was checked against the 102-page and 97-page
renders of 2026-07-27, not against the source alone.
