# SOURCE_LEDGER.md — round 6, every reference, every changed number, every open flag

**Built 2026-07-28 by the ledger track.** State measured at `01915ba7` and re-anchored at
`4e84cf7a` (the per-section chapter split, which lands after every other track and whose render is
byte-identical). This file is the audit trail for the round, not a review of it: it maps each
reference to its identifier and to the claim it carries, each changed number to the file and field
it was quoted from, and each `[VERIFY]` to its owner.

**Provenance rule this file obeys.** Every row says **who** verified it. `LEDGER` means I resolved
the identifier or reproduced the number myself, this session, from the source named in the row.
`INHERITED` means the verdict rests on another pass's report and I did not re-derive it; those rows
are usable as a map, not as verification. The distinction is the point of the file: the author does
not trust self-reported success, and a ledger that prints another agent's "verified" as its own is
worse than no ledger.

**Coordinates.** Line numbers are as of **2026-07-28 at `4e84cf7a`**, after the split. The phrase in
each row is the stable key; a bare `file:line` in this repository has a shelf life of about one
commit (`ANCHORS.md` §5). Every coordinate below was re-resolved by phrase against the split tree,
not carried forward from the source reports.

## 0 · What the round actually changed, and what I measured myself

`git log 870f882c..HEAD` is 18 commits (17 to `01915ba7`, plus the split). The diff touches
**23 `.tex` files, `GLOSSARY.md`, `references.bib` (in the earlier `9893a2c1`), four `src_utils`
documents and four checkers.** Measured over the whole round window `7343c8ad^..HEAD`:

| What | Measured |
|---|---|
| Net-new `\cite` keys in prose | **zero** — no key enters or leaves the document this round |
| Citation instances whose **sentence** changed | **3** (`standley2020tasks`, `nash`, `paiva2026stmtlnet`) |
| Bibliography entries re-typed | **2** (`kokkinos2016ubernet`, `mai2023sphere2vec…`), at `9893a2c1` |
| Prose lines carrying a numeral, added | **24** (797 further numerals are inside `%` comments and do not render) |
| Errata rows added | **2** (one B.1, one B.3) + **2** bibliography rows (B.4) |
| `[NEEDS SIGN-OFF]` markers now in `src/` | **43** across 18 files |
| `[VERIFY]` markers now in `src/` | **8** across 6 files |

**Build, measured by me in an isolated `git archive` tree, not taken from a commit message:**
`make defense` 108 pp, `make final` 105 pp, `make ppgc` 109 pp; on all three logs
`tex_errors=0`, `overfull_hbox=0`, `overfull_vbox=0`, `Float too large=0`, `undef_cite=0`,
`undef_ref=0`. Reproduced at both `01915ba7` and `4e84cf7a` with identical page counts.

**`make check` exits 1**, at `4e84cf7a` and equally at `01915ba7` and at the round's starting point
`870f882c`, on one gate: `'this paper' / 'this article' inside chapters`, hitting
`chapters/apx_b_errata.tex:307` ("This article differs from the other two in a way that changes what
this section has to record"). The sentence entered at `d1911c0a`, before this round. **The round's
"`make check` all gates pass" claim is therefore not reproducible as stated** (finding L-1 below);
the page-count gate that earlier reports flagged is now green.

---

## A · Every new or changed reference this round

Twenty-three rows: the two bibliography entries re-typed to their versions of record, the three
citation instances whose sentence changed, and every reference a round-6 verdict turned on. **No
reference was added to or removed from `references.bib` after `9893a2c1`**, and no citing site
gained or lost a key, so the table is short by design.

### A.1 · Entries whose bibliography record changed (identifier re-resolved by me)

| Bib key | Identifier | Where opened, by which pass | Claim it supports (file + phrase) | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `kokkinos2016ubernet` | DOI `10.1109/CVPR.2017.579`; preprint `arXiv:1609.02132` | **LEDGER**: Crossref REST this session → `proceedings-article`, "2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)", 2017, pp. 5454-5463, sole author Iasonas Kokkinos; arXiv API → same title/author, submitted 2016-09-07, **no `journal_ref`, no DOI on the preprint**. Originally by the citation pass (`11_citation_claims.md` §6.1) | `chapters/3_cbic/basis.tex` — UberNet as the hard-sharing exemplar; **metadata only, no claim depends on the venue** | **corrected** (`@article` preprint → `@inproceedings` CVPR 2017). Crossref renders the title without the quotation marks around `Universal`; the bib keeps the author's own typography, which is defensible and is disclosed in the entry comment |
| `mai2023sphere2vecgeneralpurposelocationrepresentation` | DOI `10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2023.06.016`; preprint `arXiv:2306.17624` | **LEDGER**: Crossref REST this session → `journal-article`, ISPRS J. Photogramm. Remote Sens., 2023, v.202, pp. 439-462, ISSN 0924-2716, eight authors in the bib's order; arXiv API → `journal_ref` "ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 2023" and comment "Accepted to ISPRS…". Originally by the citation pass (§6.2) | `chapters/1_introduction.tex:48-50` — "was first validated on geospatial tasks such as species recognition and remote sensing classification"; four further sites in Ch.2/Ch.4 | **corrected** (`@misc` → `@article` with volume, pages, DOI). Identifier fully resolved; **the claim at the Ch.1 site is separately PARTIAL**, see A.3 row 15 |

Both rows carry an Appendix B bibliography erratum (`tables/frame/bib_errata.tex`, rows 17 and 18
of B.4). The Sphere2Vec row **names the work rather than printing the key**, because a 52-character
`\texttt` key does not line-break and produced `Overfull \hbox (113.58371pt too wide)` — the only
overfull box in either build at the time. I confirm **0 overfull boxes in all three builds now**.

### A.2 · Citation instances whose sentence changed this round

| Bib key | Identifier | Where opened, by which pass | Claim now made (file:line + phrase) | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `standley2020tasks` | `arXiv:1905.07553v4`, comment field "Presented to ICML 2020" | **LEDGER**: arXiv API record + **PDF v4 and v3 both downloaded and read this session (13 pp. each)**; nine quotations re-checked by exact substring match after normalizing the extractor's soft-hyphen codepoint (`U+FFFE`). Originally by the protocol pass (`10_protocol_recovery.md` §4) and the claim-scoping pass (`15_claim_scoping_applied.md` §5) | `chapters/3_cbic/method.tex:92` — "In practice, sharing one network across tasks reduces inference cost, since a single network is evaluated rather than one network per task", with a footnote reproducing the published sentence | **corrected**, and **I confirm the correction independently**: the surviving inference-cost half is p.1 abstract verbatim; the removed accuracy half is contradicted on p.1 ("this often leads to inferior overall performance as task objectives can compete") and p.2 ("multi-task learning is often inferior to single task learning with multiple networks"); "faster training" occurs **0** times, while "reduced training time" occurs once on p.1 inside a list the paper hedges "in theory". **One page attribution in the applied comment is wrong**, see finding L-2 |
| `nash` (Navon et al., Nash-MTL) | `arXiv:2202.01017v2`, comment field "ICML 2022"; DBLP `conf/icml/NavonSAMKCF22` (Semantic Scholar) | **LEDGER**: arXiv API + **PDF downloaded and read this session (19 pp.)**; Semantic Scholar `paper/arXiv:2202.01017` for the venue record. Originally by the protocol pass (§3) | `chapters/4_courb/methodology.tex:36` — "Away from a Pareto-stationary point … and under the method's assumption that the gradients are linearly independent there, that direction is a descent direction for every task" | **corrected** (published "ensures that the update is beneficial for all tasks simultaneously" → conditional form), and **I confirm both conditions at source**: p.1 abstract "Under certain as-sumptions"; p.3 "Our main assumption, besides the ones used by Nash, is that if θ is not Pareto stationary then the gradients are linearly independent"; p.6 "Since our update rule is a descent direction for all tasks". **Page range still UNRESOLVED**, see A.4 |
| `paiva2026stmtlnet` | DOI `10.5753/courb.2026.22960` | **LEDGER**: Crossref REST this session → "Anais do X Workshop de Computação Urbana (CoUrb 2026)", 2026, pp. 323-336, four authors (Tarik S. Paiva, Vitor H. O. Silva, Germano B. dos Santos, Fabrício A. Silva), publisher SBC | `chapters/4_courb.tex:18` — the chapter preface's venue, page range and DOI | **supported**; the sentence changed only by re-wrapping, and the bib entry matches Crossref field for field (authors, venue, pages, year, DOI) |

### A.3 · References carrying a round-6 verdict of PARTIAL, NOT-SUPPORTED or UNVERIFIABLE

Twenty-five key instances out of 265 audited. **These verdicts are INHERITED from
`11_citation_claims.md` and its seven per-chapter reports**; what I did myself is (a) resolve each
identifier at Crossref/arXiv/OpenAlex, and (b) re-anchor every site into the split tree. I did not
re-read every source, so the "verdict" column is that pass's judgment, not mine, except where the
row says LEDGER.

**Twenty-one of the 25 are in reproduced published prose** (15 Ch.3, 6 Ch.4), so they are
errata-policy decisions and not free edits. Chapter 2, the most heavily cited unit at 70 key
instances, carries **none**; the frame chapters carry **one** between them (row 15). That asymmetry
is the shape of the citation risk in this document and it is worth carrying forward.

### A.4 · UNRESOLVED — identifiers I could not resolve myself

| Bib key | What is missing | What I did | What would close it |
|---|---|---|---|
| `nash` | The `pages = {16428--16446}` field. **No source of record I can reach carries a page range.** | Crossref has no DOI for the ICML version; OpenAlex returns only the arXiv preprint (`W4225981399`, `biblio.first_page = null`); Semantic Scholar confirms the venue (DBLP `conf/icml/NavonSAMKCF22`, ICML 2022) but no pages; `proceedings.mlr.press` and `dblp.org` are both outside the network allowlist (proxy 403, one attempt each). | One look at `proceedings.mlr.press/v162/navon22a.html`. The precedent set in this same bibliography was to **drop** an unverifiable page range (`standley2020tasks`), so consistency argues for dropping it or verifying it. |
| `ruder2017sluice` | The entry's **title and type are the preprint's**, and the work has a version of record the entry does not name. | arXiv API: the v3 title of record is "Latent Multi-task Architecture Learning" (not "Sluice Networks…"), comment "To appear in Proceedings of AAAI 2019"; Crossref `10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33014822` gives AAAI v.33 pp. 4822-4829, 2019, same four authors. Both resolved by **LEDGER**. | An author decision: this is the same preprint-to-version-of-record upgrade already applied to UberNet and Sphere2Vec, and it interacts with the row-1 claim defect. See finding L-3. |
| `santos2024urban` | No external identifier, and there will not be one (a UFV master's dissertation). | Not re-checked by me. INHERITED: the citation pass verified it against the PDF in `exemples/germano/`. | Nothing; it needs a bib comment saying so, or a future existence checker reads the absence as a defect. |
| `chen2018gradnorm`, `holm1979`, `jure2014snap`, `kohavi1995crossval`, `kurin2022scalarization`, `liu2023famo`, `pedregosa2011sklearn`, `senushkin2023aligned`, `velickovic2019deep`, `wongso2025massivesteps`, `xin2022domtl`, `yu2020pcgrad` | **No identifier field in the bib entry** (12 entries). | Not re-resolved by me this round; none of them changed. INHERITED: the citation pass resolved each against OpenAlex or the arXiv API and reports the record it returned. | Adding the resolved identifier to each entry, which is a bib edit no round-6 track owned. |
| `capanema2023poirgnn`, `wang2025hamtl`, `zeng2019next`, `Halder2021` | **No abstract at any reachable source**, so the claim check for these four ran on title and record only. | Not re-attempted by me (Elsevier/Springer landing pages are outside the allowlist). INHERITED and explicitly declared in `11_citation_claims.md` §11 item 2. | Reading those four papers. Every citing site is an identity-of-baseline pointer, so no mechanism claim rests on them. |

## B · Every changed number this round

**Method.** I extracted every numeral from the added lines of `git diff 870f882c..HEAD -- '*.tex'`
and split them by whether the line renders. **24 numerals are on prose lines; 797 are inside `%`
comments** and never reach the reader. The table covers the 24, plus the four numbers that changed
inside `articles/[mobiwac]/src/` and the counts inside Appendix B's own reconciliation header.
"Quoted" means the value appears in the named source with the named field; "recomputed" means I
re-derived it from primary data this session.

| # | Number, as it now appears | Where it appears (2026-07-28) | Source file → field | Convention | Quoted / recomputed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7` (the HGI sweep grid) | `chapters/2_fundamentals.tex:172` | `research/embeddings/hgi/README.md:548-551` → the four `w_r` rows | four settings, one per row | **quoted; reproduced by me** — the four rows are literally 0.4 / 0.5 / 0.6 / **0.7** |
| 2 | `0.7388 \pm 0.0205` | `chapters/2_fundamentals.tex:174` | same, `:548` → `Cat F1` | Alabama, 5 folds × 50 epochs, 0-1 scale, spread across folds | **quoted; reproduced by me** verbatim |
| 3 | `0.8186 \pm 0.0123` | same line | same, `:551` → `Cat F1` at the adopted `w_r`=0.7 | as above | **quoted; reproduced by me** verbatim |
| 4 | `50` epochs | `chapters/2_fundamentals.tex:173` | same, `:544` → the sweep header "(5 folds × 50 epochs…)" | budget per fold | **quoted; reproduced by me** |
| — | *(what this replaced)* | — | the prose previously read "rose monotonically from **0.74 to 0.82**" | the round's NUM-4 fix: a rounded restatement replaced by the record's own values plus the convention | the word "monotonically" is the **source's own** (`hgi/CLAUDE.md:117`), not a computed judgment |
| 5 | `0.4 / 0.3 / 0.3` (Check2HGI loss weights) | `chapters/2_fundamentals.tex:246`, Eq. `eq:fund:check2hgi` | `docs/context/check2hgi_overview.tex:215` → the displayed objective; **and** `research/embeddings/check2hgi/model/Check2HGIModule.py:51-53` → `alpha_c2p=0.4, alpha_p2r=0.3, alpha_r2c=0.3`, summed at `:1192-1195` | fixed weights, one per hierarchy boundary | **quoted; reproduced by me at both sources**, which agree |
| 6 | `0` and `1` (the discriminator's range) | `chapters/2_fundamentals.tex:250` | property of the logistic function, stated in the same sentence that defines σ | definitional, not measured | not a data number |
| 7 | `284` and `365` (fine-class values per state) | `chapters/apx_b_static_scope.tex:19` | `data/checkins_by_state/{Alabama…Texas}.parquet` → `spot` column, `nunique` after `drop_duplicates("placeid")` | POI-level (deduplicated by `placeid`), five Gowalla states, min and max of the five | **RECOMPUTED BY ME FROM THE PARQUET FILES**: AL 11,848 POIs / 284 values, AZ 20,666 / 305, FL 76,544 / 324, CA 169,145 / 333, TX 160,938 / 365; **0 spot values spanning more than one category in any state**. All five rows and the "every one of them maps to" claim reproduce exactly |
| 8 | `42` (partition seed) | `chapters/apx_a_contributions.tex:107` | `docs/context/DATA_SPLITS.md:16` → `StratifiedGroupKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)`; `:20` "Random seed = 42 (fold-id seed)" | fold-id seed, fixed across model-init seeds | **quoted; reproduced by me** |
| 9 | `0, 1, 7, and 100` (seeds) | `chapters/apx_a_contributions.tex:113` | `DATA_SPLITS.md:65` → "**Seeds {0, 1, 7, 100}** … Combined with 5 folds → n=20" | four random initializations over ONE fixed partition; n = 20 fitted models, n = 4 inferential unit | **quoted; reproduced by me** |
| 10 | `5` folds, `80%` / `20%` | `chapters/4_courb/results.tex:14` (re-wrapped, value unchanged) | the published CoUrb table conventions | published prose; the round added only the split-axis and checkpoint clauses around it | quoted (unchanged) |
| 11 | `0.68` and `0.19` (balancer margins) | `chapters/5_mobiwac/02_related.tex:114-115` and `articles/[mobiwac]/src/sections/02_related.tex` | `docs/results/mtl_improvement/T4_full_screen.json` → `alabama.{nash_mtl,scale_norm}.cat` minus `alabama.equal_weight.cat` | macro-F1 points against equal weighting, registry defaults, **seed 0, Alabama and Florida only** | **RECOMPUTED BY ME**: Nash-MTL `+0.6805`, scale normalization `+0.1931`. Both round correctly. The "collapsing on next-region" clause also holds: scale_norm at Florida is `−37.59` reg points |
| 12 | `nineteen` balancers | same sentence | `T4_full_screen.json` → 19 keys under each of `alabama` and `florida` | count of screened arms per dataset | **RECOMPUTED BY ME**: 19 arms, both states, names enumerated |

Abstract 272, not 271** (11 sentences, mean 24.7). The one-word gap is a hyphenation artifact: p.3 carries two soft-hyphen breaks (`Rep-resentations`, `multi-task`); joining across them gives 271, treating them as breaks gives 272. **Neither is wrong, but the report's own §1 rule 7 says hyphenation is undone before matching, so 271 is the value its stated convention yields and the instrument as shipped returns 272.** See finding L-4 |

## C · Every `[VERIFY]` flag still open, deduplicated

Fourteen open, one withdrawn. Sources: the four flags of `11_citation_claims.md` §10, the four of
`10_protocol_recovery.md` §6, the five of `15_claim_scoping_applied.md` §10, the eight of
`15_resumo_abstract.md` §7, the two blocking GLOSSARY entries of `16_frame_numbers.md`, and the
eight `[VERIFY]` markers physically in `src/`. Deduplicated: the Nash page range appears in three
reports, the joint-model column in two, the page-count gate in three.

| ID | Flag | Owner | Status | What would close it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| V-1 | `chapters/3_cbic/method.tex:207`, `nash`: "task weights can be updated less frequently, significantly reducing runtime while maintaining performance" | citation pass; **re-checked by me** | **open, and I confirm it** — I read the 19-page PDF this session and did not locate the claim; the paper caps its CCP iterations at 20, which is a different statement | The passage in `arXiv:2202.01017`, or restating the clause as this chapter's own engineering choice |
| V-2 | `chapters/3_cbic/method.tex:23`, `huang2022estimating`: the edge-weight formula attributed to the cited work | citation pass | open (UNVERIFIABLE, not refuted) | Locating the formula in the paper body, or presenting it as this work's own construction |
| V-3 | `chapters/4_courb/related.tex:16`, `rahmani2019category`: the sequential/temporal-order half | citation pass | open | The paper body; Crossref deposits only a four-sentence abstract |
| V-4 | `chapters/5_mobiwac/…`, `huang2024cslsl`: the sentence cites CSLSL's own ablation | citation pass | open | The paper's results section; an abstract cannot carry an ablation |
| V-5 | `nash` page range `16428--16446` | protocol pass, claim-scoping pass, **and me** | **open; escalated** — I exhausted Crossref, OpenAlex and Semantic Scholar; PMLR and DBLP are outside the allowlist | One look at `proceedings.mlr.press/v162/navon22a.html`, or drop the field per the `standley2020tasks` precedent |
| V-6 | The published CBIC joint-model next-category column reproduces from **no** artifact in this repository (0 of 21 cells) | protocol pass | open **by decision**, registered as `LEFT_OUT.md` LO-2 | Nothing; the constraint it imposes is that no sentence may claim the CBIC numbers are reproducible from this repository without excluding that column |
| V-7 | The CBIC/CoUrb tuning budget is not recoverable | protocol pass | open **by decision**, registered as `LEFT_OUT.md` LO-1 | Nothing; the number is not available, and `N1` forbids writing one |
| V-8 | `chapters/2_fundamentals.tex:601-602`: "Chapter 3 reports five-fold cross-validation without identifying the split axis" is **false** now that the Ch.3 protocol sentence has landed | claim-scoping pass → **frame owner** | **open, and I confirm it in the RENDER, not only the source**: the false clause prints on **p. 23** and the Ch.3 addition that contradicts it prints on **p. 36** (`chapters/3_cbic/results.tex:30`). The clause wraps across two source lines, so a single-line `grep` misses it — use a whole-file string search | The repair drafted in the comment at the Ch.3 site: "Chapters 3 and 4 both stratify by sample rather than by user … and only Chapter 5 splits by user" |
| V-9 | `make check` page-count gate | figures pass, citation pass, claim-scoping pass | **CLOSED by me** — the gate is green at `4e84cf7a`: "all recorded page counts agree with the build". `make check` still exits 1, but on a different gate (finding L-1) | — |
| V-10 | GLOSSARY: **bilinear discriminator** and **logistic function** used in the new Ch.2 Check2HGI paragraph, neither registered | frame-numbers pass → **glossary owner** | **open and blocking** by the fail-closed rule. I confirm both terms are absent from `GLOSSARY.md` and present in the rendered paragraph | The author approving the two proposed entries (`16_frame_numbers.md` §4) |
| V-11 | GLOSSARY: **Pareto-stationary point**, used in the narrowed Ch.4 Nash sentence | claim-scoping pass → **glossary owner** | **open and blocking**, same rule. The term is live at `chapters/4_courb/methodology.tex:36` | The author approving the proposed entry (`15_claim_scoping_applied.md` §9) |
| V-12 | GLOSSARY §6: "modelos ajustados" and four further PT phrasings used in the Resumo | resumo pass → **glossary owner** | **partly closed**: `01915ba7` registered nine PT rows including `vinte modelos ajustados`, `usuários disjuntos entre treino e teste`, `partição`, `média por inicialização`, `seleção joint-best`. I confirm all nine are now in `GLOSSARY.md` | Nothing further for those five; the flag closes |
| V-13 | The pair is above the defended envelope (Resumo 310 vs 282 max, Abstract 271/272 vs 250) | resumo pass → **author** | open by decision, reported rather than smoothed | An author ruling on whether to spend the last 20-30 words |
| V-14 | The averaging convention of the HGI sweep's "Cat F1" (macro or weighted) is named nowhere | frame-numbers pass | open; the prose says "category F1" and not "macro-F1" for exactly this reason | The HGI run configuration |
| V-15 | `chapters/apx_a_contributions.tex:185,195`: whether `METRICS.md`'s Δm variants and F51 extraction rule should be disclosed; whether a package-version manifest exists | frame-numbers pass → **author** | open | An author decision plus, for the manifest, its existence |
| **C-W1** | **WITHDRAWN** — "The CA and TX category cells are provisional in the statistical record, and no frame text says so", raised as flag 1 of `15_resumo_abstract.md` §7 | resumo pass; withdrawn by the round supervisor at `35fe46cc` | **Withdrawn, and I re-verified the withdrawal independently.** `stats_n20/RESULTS.md` is at **rev 4, 2026-07-13**; its header table reports all six datasets rejecting at α = 0.05 (CA Δcat **+6.45**, TX **+7.45**, both Holm-adjusted p = 8.9e-07, m = 6) and states that A1 landed the CA/TX n=20 runs on 2026-07-11. The material the flag quoted sits under a heading that reads literally `## 1b · CA / TX — seed-0 paired analysis (✅ A1 n=20 now COMPLETE — supersede via M1-full re-run)`, and §1b's own banner says the n=20 "**confirms** the provisional seed-0 verdicts". **So "at all six" is correct and carries no undisclosed provisional footing.** Recorded here so it is not re-raised: the lesson is that this record keeps its superseded revisions inline, so **anchor on the revision header, not on the first matching line** | Nothing; it is closed. Recorded so it is not re-raised |

**One flag adjacent to C-W1 that is NOT withdrawn and is not in any report as a flag.** The same
record's §1b correction of 2026-07-27 establishes that **next-region superiority was never
pre-registered** and that the four region gains are post-hoc secondary results. Chapter 5 discloses
this at `chapters/5_mobiwac/05_setup.tex:76` ("did not cover next-region superiority, so the four
next-region gains … are secondary results outside it"). **The Resumo, the Abstract, Chapter 1 and
Chapter 6 all state "outperforms … at four of six" with no such qualifier.** That is a scoping
question for the author, not a number error, and I raise it as finding L-5 rather than as a flag,
because no round-6 pass owned it.

## D · Findings this track raises

| ID | Severity | Anchor | Measured | Conclusion | Closes when |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **L-1** | **MAJOR** | `make check`; `chapters/apx_b_errata.tex:307` "This article differs from the other two" | I ran `bash ../src_utils/check.sh` in isolated `git archive` trees at `870f882c`, `01915ba7` and `4e84cf7a`. **All three exit 1**, all three on the `'this paper' / 'this article' inside chapters` gate, hitting that one line. The sentence entered at `d1911c0a`, before this round. `make check` on the live tree also exits nonzero | The round state given to me says "`make check` all gates pass", and the split commit's own message repeats it. That is **not reproducible**; one gate has been red across the whole round window. It is a false-negative in a *report*, not in the document, and the offending sentence is arguably a legitimate use ("this article" refers to the MobiWac manuscript, not to the dissertation) — but a gate that is known-red and reported green is exactly the failure mode `AGENT_GUARDRAILS` §7 names | Either the sentence is rephrased, or the gate gains a documented exemption for that file (as it already has for `apx_b_errata` in the banned-words gate), and the build claim is restated as "all gates pass except X, exempted because Y" |
| **L-7** | **MAJOR** | `chapters/2_fundamentals.tex:601-602` "reports five-fold cross-validation without identifying the split axis" vs `chapters/3_cbic/results.tex:30` "The folds are formed by a stratified splitter over the samples" | Both printed in the defense PDF: the false clause on **p. 23**, the sentence that falsifies it on **p. 36**. Verified on the rendered text layer, not only in the source. The clause wraps across two source lines, which is why a line-anchored `grep` reports it absent | The claim-scoping pass named this as owed and drafted the repair; **it was not applied, and it is now a contradiction a reader can see thirteen pages apart** — the frame says a chapter does not state something the chapter states. Raised as `[VERIFY]` V-8 by that pass, but it is a defect in the document rather than an open question, which is why it is also a finding here | The Ch.2 clause is replaced by the drafted repair, and the whole-file string search returns nothing |
| **L-2** | MINOR | `chapters/3_cbic/method.tex:136` comment: "p.7 reports that at a matched parameter budget" | I read `arXiv:1905.07553` v4 **and** v3. The matched-budget sentence and "Nevertheless, two-task networks still do not compare favorably" are both on **p.4** in both versions; p.7 carries the 45-versus-95-percent training-time comparison, which is the *other* claim the same comment cites correctly | One page attribution in an applied audit comment is off by three pages. The claim itself is right and the errata row does not print a page, so nothing the reader sees is wrong; but the comment is the audit trail a future checker will use | The comment reads p.4 for the matched-budget result |
| **L-3** | MINOR | `references.bib`, `ruder2017sluice`: `title = {Sluice Networks: Learning What to Share Between Loosely Related Tasks}`, `journal = {arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.08142}` | arXiv API: the title of record at v3 is **"Latent Multi-task Architecture Learning"**, comment "To appear in Proceedings of AAAI 2019". Crossref `10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33014822`: AAAI v.33, pp. 4822-4829, 2019, same four authors | The entry names a superseded preprint title and no version of record — the same defect this round **fixed** for UberNet and Sphere2Vec, left in place for a third entry, which is also the key carrying the round's highest-load NOT-SUPPORTED verdict. Two decisions on one entry are cheaper than two passes over it | The entry is re-typed to the AAAI record (or the claim decision at row 1 is taken and the entry updated in the same commit), with a B.4 row |
| **L-4** | MINOR | `15_resumo_abstract.md` §2 table, "Abstract, after **271**" | I ran the report's own instrument (`_measure_abs.py`) on p.3 of the rendered defense PDF: **272** words, 11 sentences, mean 24.7. The Resumo reproduces exactly at 310/11/28.2. The one-word gap is two soft-hyphen breaks on p.3 (`Rep-resentations`, `multi-task`); joining across them yields 271 | The instrument as shipped does not apply the hyphenation normalization its own §1 rule 7 declares, so the reported 271 and the reproducible 272 differ by one. Immaterial to the envelope argument; material to a ledger, because the number is quoted in a durable record and does not reproduce | The instrument normalizes soft hyphens before counting, or the report states which of the two conventions its figure is on |
| **L-5** | MINOR | `chapters/5_mobiwac/05_setup.tex:76` "did not cover next-region superiority, so the four next-region gains … are secondary results"; against `0_main.tex:249,332`, `chapters/1_introduction.tex:132`, `chapters/6_conclusion.tex:21,75` | Chapter 5 discloses that region superiority is outside the pre-registered plan. The Resumo, the Abstract, Chapter 1 and Chapter 6 all say the joint model "outperforms" on region "at four of six" with no such qualifier. The statistics record's own 2026-07-27 correction confirms the registered primary test for **every** region cell is TOST non-inferiority | A scope that Chapter 5 states and the frame does not. Not a number error and not a verb error (the four gains do pass a paired test), but the frame's four claims are one hedge weaker in the chapter than in the summary. No round-6 track owned this | An author ruling: either the frame adds "as a secondary result" once, or the asymmetry is recorded as deliberate in `LEFT_OUT.md` |
| **L-6** | MINOR | 443 `file:line` coordinates across the fifteen `_round6/*.md` reports | Resolved every one against the live tree: **279 of 443 (63%) now land past the end of the file they name**, because `3_cbic.tex`, `4_courb.tex` and `5_mobiwac.tex` are 55, 42 and 50 lines long after the split. `11_claims_3_cbic.md` alone carries 77 such coordinates, `11_claims_5_mobiwac.md` 56, `11_claims_4_courb.md` 54, `11_citation_claims.md` 48, `10_protocol_recovery.md` 23 | The round's own reports are now largely un-navigable by coordinate, which is the exact failure `ANCHORS.md` was written to stop. The findings survive; the addresses do not. Every load-bearing coordinate is re-resolved in tables A and B above and in `VERIFY_LIST.md` | Nothing needs editing in those reports; this ledger and `VERIFY_LIST.md` are the current address book. Future reports cite the phrase |

**What holds.** The two bibliography upgrades are correct field for field at Crossref. The Standley
correction is right at source on all nine quotations, including the one an earlier draft got wrong.
The Nash narrowing states exactly the two conditions the paper states, in the paper's own terms. The
HGI sweep values, the Check2HGI weights, the seeds, the partition seed, the 5.3-to-9.4 range, the
four-of-six region count, the two balancer margins, the nineteen arms, the 284-to-365 fine-class
counts and the 43-row errata reconciliation **all reproduce exactly** — several of them recomputed
from primary data rather than re-read from a report. The withdrawn flag was correctly withdrawn.
Three builds are clean at 108/105/109 with every counter zero.

## E · What this track could not confirm

1. **Twenty-one of the 25 citation verdicts in table A.3 are INHERITED.** I resolved every
   identifier myself and re-anchored every site, but I re-read the source for only three keys
   (`standley2020tasks`, `nash`, and the four Crossref-checkable attribute sets). The
   claim-support judgments for the other rows are `11_citation_claims.md`'s.
2. **The fan-out that report describes did not happen** (its own §11 item 1): one agent ran all
   seven per-chapter units. So the 265-instance audit is one pair of eyes, not seven, and this
   ledger is a second pair over its identifiers and its numbers — not over its readings.
3. **I did not re-derive the gradient-cosine `+0.001`**, the Appendix C word counts, the CoUrb
   additions count, or the figure-geometry measurements of `12_figures.md`. Those rows are marked
   INHERITED.
4. **The `nash` page range is unresolved and cannot be resolved from this sandbox** (PMLR and DBLP
   are outside the allowlist; one attempt each, both proxy-refused).
5. **I did not audit the render beyond the front matter and the page counts.** The figure label
   sizes, the float placements and the Chapter 5 diagram geometry are `12_figures.md`'s
   measurements and I did not repeat them.
6. **I built in the live tree once**, which rewrote the tracked `src/dissertacao.pdf`; I restored it
   with `git checkout` and confirmed the working tree is clean at the HEAD blob hash. Every
   measurement reported above comes from isolated `git archive` trees under `/tmp`, not from that
   build.
