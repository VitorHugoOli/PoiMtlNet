# ANCHORS.md — every audit coordinate re-resolved against the live build (round 6)

**Written 2026-07-28**, against `src/build/main.pdf` (**104 pp**) and `src/build/main_final.pdf`
(**99 pp**), both rebuilt after `ba90aa6d` restored the brace that had stopped `make` from producing
anything since `6d780b58`. `tex_errors=0` on both.

## Why this file exists

`CODEX_AUDIT.md` was written against a 97/92-page pair, re-anchored once to 102/97, and annotated
against 103/98 and 104/99 at different times. `PENDENCIAS.md` cites coordinates from all of those.
**Of the 79 resolvable `file:line` coordinates those two documents cite, 25 now land on a comment
line, a blank line, or past the end of the file.** The findings survive; the coordinates do not.

This file re-resolves the load-bearing ones **by content**, which is the only stable key. Line
numbers below were measured on 2026-07-28 and will drift again; the phrase will not.

## 2 · Four audit statements that the live build no longer supports

1. **The Appendix B oversized float is gone.** Both logs report **zero**
   `Float too large for page` warnings. The audit measured 21.55853 pt; that measurement was taken
   from a build of the source *before* the longtable conversion, and the conversion fixed it. The
   author's instruction to fix it now is therefore already satisfied; what remains is only to
   re-check after the Resumo rewrite moves pagination.
2. **The Ch.5 diagram labels are confirmed, and one page number moved.** Measured font sizes, not
   glyph bounding boxes: body is **11.96 pt**; the two diagrams carry **6.97 and 7.27 pt**, that is
   58 percent of body size, at **449 and 427 glyphs below 9 pt** on **pp. 62 and 65**. The audit said
   pp. 62 and 64. Page 65 is the correct second page in this build.
3. **The near-blank p. 4 is confirmed, precisely.** It carries the `Palavras-chave:` heading and five
   keyword lines, **21 words in total**, and nothing else.
4. **The `[NEEDS SIGN-OFF]` count is 32, not 31.** Measured across `src/`: `0_main.tex` 6,
   `5_mobiwac.tex` 6, `6_conclusion.tex` 6, `apx_a_contributions.tex` 4, `apx_b_errata.tex` 3,
   `1_introduction.tex` 2, `2_fundamentals.tex` 2, and one each in Appendices C, D and E. The audit's
   31 was correct when written; `5_mobiwac.tex` has gained one since.

## 3 · Five items the audit lists as fixable that are already done

Recorded so nobody spends the round redoing them. Each was verified by reading the live prose line.

| Audit item | Evidence it is done |
|---|---|
| §6 item 2, NUM-3 Ch.6 gradient scope | `6_conclusion.tex:177` reads "four Gowalla states, three of which are among the five we report". The "three of the six datasets" wording is gone. |
| §6 item 11, COD-004 trunk attribution | `5_mobiwac.tex:772` reads "the joint architecture lifts the next-category task". The component attribution is gone, and the comment at :775-778 records the change. |
| §6 item 14, COD-005 balancer screen scope | **PARTLY.** `5_mobiwac.tex:186` names the default configurations and the two datasets ("including the two named above", that is Alabama and Florida); `:211` names four seeds on four Gowalla states for the *gradient-cosine* measurement, which is a different measurement. **The screen's own seed is still not stated anywhere in prose.** That single clause is the residue. |
| COD-010 capacity sentence | `6_conclusion.tex:118` carries the corrected count, the mean and the SD. |
| COD-005 Nash cost claim | `3_cbic.tex:242` now reads "That cost claim is corrected here rather than reproduced", so the claim is corrected in the chapter, not merely reported in Appendix B. |

## 4 · One orphan the author asked to close

`\label{apx:ethics}` is declared at `apx_e_ethics.tex:8` and referenced **nowhere**. The author asked
for a short pointer from Chapter 1, near the data description.

## 5 · How to cite a coordinate from here on

Cite the **phrase**, and give the line number as of a stated date. A bare `file:line` in a durable
record is a claim with a shelf life of about one commit.
