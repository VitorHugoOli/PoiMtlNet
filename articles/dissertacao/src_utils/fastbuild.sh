# fastbuild.sh -- one target, three passes, loading the precompiled preamble format.
#
#   usage: src_utils/fastbuild.sh <target> [srcdir]      target = defense | final | ppgc
#
# WHAT IT IS FOR. A three-pass build spends most of its time re-reading the same preamble
# (abntex2 + memoir + newtxmath + hyperref + abntex2cite) three times. This script loads the
# format dump that src_utils/mkformat.py produces instead. MEASURED cold, this session:
# 122.7 s -> 15.4 s for the defense build. Full table, with the contention caveat:
# src_utils/_round7/20_build_speed.md §3.
#
# WHAT IT IS NOT. It is an ACCELERATOR, never a requirement. `make defense`, `make final` and
# `make ppgc` do not use it and keep working with no format present -- that matters because
# Overleaf cannot load a local format dump, and because the plain path is what six rounds of
# verification are calibrated against. If anything about the format looks wrong, use `make`.
#
# THE STALENESS GUARD IS NOT OPTIONAL AND IS NOT ADVISORY. A format dump is silently wrong
# when the preamble changes under it: the build succeeds, the PDF is stale, and nothing in the
# log says so. That is the exact shape of science/AGENT_HANDOFF.md §2.3b (a PDF existing is
# not evidence the source is correct). So this script REFUSES to run on a stale key rather
# than warning about it; `make fast` calls mkformat.py --build first, which re-dumps when the
# preamble moved (measured 33.7 s and 36.0 s in this session's two runs) and does nothing when
# it did not.
#
# AUX ISOLATION. Each target writes into build/<stem>-aux/, its own output directory, and the
# three result files are copied back into build/ afterwards -- the same arrangement the
# Makefile's plain targets use, and for the same reason. All three targets used to share
# build/chapters/*.aux, so two concurrent builds corrupted each other's aux mid-write. Measured
# while writing this: a concurrent pass truncated build/chapters/4_courb.aux and the other
# build died with "Runaway argument? ... ! File ended while scanning use of \@writefile", which
# reads like a defect in chapter 4 and is nothing of the kind.
#
# NOTE for anyone tempted by -aux-directory: that flag is MiKTeX-only. TeX Live's pdflatex
# rejects it outright ("unrecognized option"), which is why the isolation is a per-target
# -output-directory plus a copy-back rather than the one-flag version.

# and later at 0 bytes, against a complete 35,586-byte aux log, while sync_page_counts.py reported
# "no page count -- the build did not finish" about a build that had finished fine. Two writers were
# involved: `make fast3` runs three fastbuild.sh concurrently under -j3, and a second agent was
# running its own build in the same tree.
# Copy to a per-process temp name in the SAME directory, then rename. rename(2) within one filesystem
# is atomic, so a reader sees either the old complete file or the new complete file, never a partial.

# tex_errors=0, and the equivalence check passed 3 of 3 against the serial reference. A build

# it is worse in one way: it trains the operator to ignore this script's exit code.
#
# `grep -c ... | tail -1` keeps grep's stdout and discards its status (the pipeline's status is
# tail's), so a zero count reads as the single word "0".
