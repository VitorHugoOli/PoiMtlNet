"""check_meta_claims.py -- flag coverage claims in durable records that carry no command.

WHY THIS EXISTS (measured). Round 6, 2026-07-28: 13.3 hours, 61 commits, 17 of them rework. Of the
14 genuine rework commits, NINE were a wrong statement about the WORK rather than about the
dissertation -- what a check covered, what a command returned, whether a gate passed. Zero were
fabricated citations: the science protocols (AGENT_GUARDRAILS §1-§2) were holding, and nothing
protected the record of the work.

AGENT_GUARDRAILS §4b V1 is the rule this enforces:

    A number about the work carries the command that produced it.

So a sentence like "all 19 commands were executed" or "the sweep covered 49 files" is only admissible
in a durable record if a runnable command sits near it. A number without its command is an opinion
with a digit in it -- and it is exactly what nine rework commits had to go back and fix.

WHAT IT CHECKS. In the author-facing and durable records (not chapter prose, not reports that are
themselves the measurement), find sentences making a COVERAGE claim -- a count paired with a
coverage verb -- and require a fenced command block or an inline `code` command within a short
window. Flags what has no command, so the writer either adds one or rewords the claim.

DELIBERATELY NARROW. It looks for a count adjacent to a coverage verb, which is the shape all nine
defects had. It does not try to parse prose generally: a checker that flags everything is a checker
people switch off, and this repository already has a documented case of a gate whose only hit was a
known-good line, which trained everyone to read past its exit code.

SELF-TEST runs before it reports, in both directions (§7: validate every new gate against a tree
where the defect is present, then against the fixed one).
