# The fold partition and the seeds: what varies with what

> **Written 2026-08-04, after the author caught a false claim in Appendix A.** The claim was that the fold
> partition is fixed at seed 42 and that only the initialization varies across the four seeds. It is wrong
> in both halves. This document exists so the next agent does not reintroduce it: the mistake is easy to

## 1 · The one-sentence answer

**Each seed draws its own fold partition.** The seed is passed straight into
`StratifiedGroupKFold(random_state=...)`, so changing the seed re-partitions the users. It is not an
initialization-only axis, and the four seeds are therefore not four repetitions over one fixed split.

## 2 · The code path, in order

| step | file:line | what it establishes |
|---|---|---|
| the split call | `src/data/folds.py:1159`, `:1247`, `:1453` | every `StratifiedGroupKFold` / `StratifiedKFold` is constructed with `shuffle=True, random_state=self.seed` |
| where `self.seed` comes from | `src/data/folds.py:1061`, `:1071` | `FoldCreator.__init__(..., seed: int = 42, ...)`, then `self.seed = seed`. **That 42 is a DEFAULT PARAMETER VALUE, and it is the only occurrence of the literal 42 in the whole file.** |
| what the runner passes | `scripts/train.py:1874` | `seed=config.seed` inside the `FoldCreator(...)` construction |
| where `config.seed` comes from | `scripts/train.py:1375-1376` | `if args.seed is not None: config = dataclasses.replace(config, seed=args.seed)`, that is, `--seed` |

The chain is `--seed` -> `config.seed` -> `FoldCreator(seed=...)` -> `random_state=`. The partition is a
function of the seed. The default 42 applies only when `--seed` is omitted.

## 3 · The code says so itself

`scripts/train.py:1961-1962`, the canon guard, emits when `--seed` is not set:

> `[canon-guard] --seed not set -> development seed 42 (overshoots §0.1 by ~+3pp CA / +8pp TX).`
> `Paper-grade numbers require --seed in {0,1,7,100}.`

**42 is the development seed and is explicitly not paper-grade.** The reported runs pass 0, 1, 7 and 100.
Prose that describes the reported protocol as using seed 42 describes the wrong runs.

## 4 · The project's own protocol already said it

The appendix that carried the false claim cited
`docs/studies/closing_data/v17_completion/STATISTICAL_PROTOCOL.md`. That file, line 15, points at
`docs/studies/pre_freeze_gates/LANE2_OVERLAP_VALIDATION.md` for

> the overlap-vs-non-overlap **unpaired-across-seed** rule (different fold partitions per arm)

and LANE2 line 75 states:

> (b) Folds are generated on-the-fly per arm (different windowed rows) -> partitions are **NOT
> bit-identical** across arms -> use **unpaired across-seed** stats, not paired per-fold.

## 5 · Measured, not argued

`sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedGroupKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=s)` on a synthetic
300-user, 12-visits-per-user frame with a 7-class label, comparing each paper seed's partition against the
seed-42 partition:

```
seed   0: rows identical to the seed-42 partition = 21.7% | users in a different fold = 235/300
seed   1: rows identical to the seed-42 partition = 22.3% | users in a different fold = 233/300
seed   7: rows identical to the seed-42 partition = 22.3% | users in a different fold = 233/300
seed 100: rows identical to the seed-42 partition = 26.0% | users in a different fold = 222/300
seed  42: rows identical to the seed-42 partition = 100.0% | users in a different fold = 0/300
```

The last row is the **control**: the instrument reports 100 percent identical when the seed is unchanged,
so the roughly 78 percent user movement in the other rows is a property of the seed and not of a matcher
that always says "different". About four users in five land in a different fold when the seed changes.

## 6 · The frozen-fold cache, and why it does not rescue the old wording

There IS a mechanism that would pin one partition across seeds. `scripts/study/freeze_folds.py` writes
`output/{engine}/{state}/folds/fold_indices_{task}.pt`, and `_resolve_folds` in `scripts/train.py:1844-1860`
prefers that cache when its input signatures still match. **The cache filename carries no seed**
(`freeze_folds.py:121`), so a cache frozen once and reused would give every seed the same partition.

That is not what the reported runs did, and the evidence is in their own logs:

- every reported-run log that mentions folds says `Generating folds on the fly (no cache at .../folds/fold_indices_*.pt)`, in
  `docs/studies/closing_data/archive/run_logs/bf16_island_runs/{alabama,arizona,florida}/champG_bf16.log`
- no `fold_indices*.pt` exists anywhere under `output/` in this checkout (`find output -name 'fold_indices*'` returns nothing)

`docs/studies/closing_data/RUN_MATRIX.md:77` does list "frozen folds" among the T3 prerequisites, so the
INTENT was to freeze. The logs show that the runs behind the reported numbers found no cache and generated
per seed. **If a future round freezes the folds and re-runs, re-measure this document before changing the
prose back.**

## 7 · What the prose may and may not say

**MAY:** each seed is a complete repetition of the five-fold experiment, drawing its own user partition and
its own initialization, so the four seeds vary both axes together.

**MAY NOT, and every one of these was in the document before 2026-08-04:**

- "a fixed partition seed of 42" -- 42 is a default the reported runs override
- "only the initialization varies across the four; the folds do not" -- inverted
- "the same fixed folds" / "one fixed set of five folds" / "over the same folds"
- the limitation "the reported intervals do not include uncertainty from resampling the user splits" --
  they DO include it, because each seed resamples the split

That last one deserves care. The old sentence UNDERSTATED the reported intervals, so correcting it makes
the result stronger, and a claim that grows on correction earns more scrutiny rather than less. What the
corrected sentence must not do is convert this into a claim that the intervals are a full account of split
variability: four draws sample that variability, they do not characterize it.

**A CONSEQUENCE FOR THE TESTS, flagged rather than resolved here.** Paired tests require the two arms to
share folds. Pairing the joint model against the dedicated model WITHIN one seed is still sound, because
both arms run under the same seed and therefore the same partition. What is not available is the
assumption that fold k of seed 0 is fold k of seed 1. The reported tests pair per-seed MEANS (n=4), which
never requires cross-seed fold identity, so the reported procedure survives this correction. Any future
analysis that pairs per (seed, fold) across seeds does not.

```
grep -n 'random_state' src/data/folds.py                          # every call takes self.seed
grep -n 'config.seed' scripts/train.py                            # what the runner passes
grep -rn 'Generating folds on the fly' docs/studies/closing_data/ # what the reported runs did
```
