"""Study-only Check2HGI builder: same v14 Design-K recipe, but it SAVES the encoder and can
restrict representation training to the training users of one fold.

Why this script exists. The frozen v14 builder (scripts/probe/build_design_k_delaunay.py) keeps
the selected state in memory and writes only the three Parquet tables, so the trained network
cannot be resumed from its output directory. Every causal intervention in this study needs the
weights, because an intervention recomputes vectors under changed inputs. This script is a copy
of that recipe with three additions and no changes to the objective, the optimizer, or the
selection rule:

  1. --save-checkpoint      persist the selected state_dict plus full provenance
  2. --exclude-users-file   drop a fold's validation users from representation training
  3. --study-root           write everywhere EXCEPT the frozen engine directories

It never writes into output/check2hgi_design_k_resln_mae_l0_1/ or output/check2hgi_dk_ovl/.

Restricting the training users requires reindexing the hierarchy, because dropping check-ins
leaves some places with no training evidence at all (measured: 4.9% of Alabama places, 3.6% of
Florida places when one fold's users are removed). Keeping them in the index space would feed
zero-vector places to the discriminator as easy negatives and give the masked-place decoder a
zero reconstruction target. So places and regions are reindexed to the training-only space, and
the spatial scaffolding is remapped through place identifiers rather than positions.

Held-out inference needs NONE of that machinery: the check-in encoder consumes only node
features and the per-user sequence edges, and the check-in graph is a disjoint union of per-user
paths, so a held-out user encoded alone reproduces its full-graph vectors exactly (phase 0, F1
and F2). Inference lives in infer_checkins.py.

SCOPE LIMIT, carried forward from the earlier fold audit deliberately. The HGI Delaunay edges and
the POI2Vec table are full-dataset artifacts and are held FIXED across arms. They are a
place-spatial prior, not a check-in-level channel, so holding them fixed isolates the check-in
channel under study. A fully inductive rebuild of the spatial scaffolding is out of scope and is
recorded as an open channel in the report.

    # the nine observed labels do not already carry. The information was never in the node.
