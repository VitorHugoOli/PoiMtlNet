"""POI2Vec model — geographically-influenced skip-gram with a spatial binary tree.

Faithfulness (Feng et al., "POI2Vec: Geographical Latent Representation for
Predicting Future Visitors", AAAI 2017, vol. 31 — https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/10500):
  Core mechanism = word2vec/skip-gram over POI check-in sequences, where the
  GEOGRAPHICAL INFLUENCE is injected through a **binary tree built over a
  recursive rectangular partition of the map** (hierarchical-softmax style).
  Each POI is assigned to leaf path(s) of the tree; the routing probabilities
  along a POI's path are shared across spatially-near POIs, so geographically
  close POIs are pulled together in the latent space. The paper also assigns a
  POI to MULTIPLE leaves with influence weights phi (a POI near a region
  boundary contributes to both sub-regions); we keep the multi-leaf influence.

  Output = a LATENT REPRESENTATION PER POI (the input/center embedding table),
  which is exactly the standalone per-POI 64-d column this baseline must emit.

Deviations from the paper (documented for the audit):
  D1. The paper's downstream task is "predict future visitors of a POI"; OUR
      board's downstream is next-category (macro-F1) + next-region (Acc@10)
      under the matched champion heads. We use ONLY POI2Vec's *representation*
      (the per-POI latent table) as a substrate column — the SC-substrate
      protocol — and let the frozen matched heads do prediction. This isolates
      the representation contribution on the substrate axis.
  D2. The paper optionally fuses a USER latent vector. We emit only the POI
      table (the substrate is per-POI / per-check-in, user identity enters
      downstream through the sequence head, not the embedding). User vectors
      are trained as the skip-gram "center" side but not exported.
  D3. The rectangular partition granularity (theta / tree depth) is a
      hyper-parameter; the paper tunes it per dataset. We use a quad-style
      recursive split to a fixed max depth with a min-POIs-per-leaf stop,
      yielding a balanced binary routing tree. Depth is configurable.
  D4. This is the AAAI'17 POI2Vec. It is DISTINCT from the in-repo
      ``research/embeddings/hgi/poi2vec.py``, which is an FCLASS-level Node2Vec
      teacher used *inside* HGI (multiple POIs of the same fclass share a
      vector). That file is NOT a standalone per-POI baseline; this module is.
