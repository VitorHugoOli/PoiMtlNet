"""Classification metric computation for POI tasks.

A single pure function converts a batch of logits + targets into a flat dict
of scalar Python floats. The dict keys are stable names (optionally prefixed)
that downstream ``MetricStore.log(**kwargs)`` calls can consume directly.

Metric choices are grounded in ``docs/LITERATURE_SURVEY_POI_METRICS.md`` and
``docs/POI_RELATED_WORK_METRICS.md``:

  * ``accuracy`` (micro) and ``f1`` (macro) — unchanged primary metrics.
  * ``accuracy_macro`` — balanced accuracy, complements micro under imbalance.
  * ``f1_weighted`` — robustness-to-imbalance secondary signal.
  * ``top{k}_acc`` for k in ``top_k`` — bridge to the next-POI recommendation
    literature (Acc@K / Recall@K in the single-label case).
  * ``mrr`` — mean reciprocal rank over the full class ranking.
  * ``ndcg_{k}`` — NDCG@K with binary single-item relevance (reduces to the
    well-defined single-label form used by ranking papers).

The ``'f1'`` key stays identical to the previous
``multiclass_f1_score(..., average='macro')`` value so existing
``BestModelTracker(monitor='f1')`` behaviour is byte-identical.

class StreamingClsMetrics:
    """Accumulate the inputs of the hand-rolled metric dict one batch at a time.

    Motivation: the "keep only per-row reductions, never materialise ``[N, C]``" trick was
    reimplemented independently in THREE places — the S2 val metric (``mtl_eval``), the S1 train
    metric (``mtl_cv``) and the p1 region ablation — each with its own copy of the same four
    accumulators and its own copy of the ``> 256`` literal. Three copies of a loop is three
    chances to get it subtly wrong, and the p1 copy shipped with a read-before-assignment that
    made every streamed run die on ``UnboundLocalError``; it was caught only by running it, since
    a unit test of ``_streamed_cls_metrics`` never touches the caller's loop. This class is the
    one implementation they now share, so a fix lands everywhere and a new caller cannot invent a
    fourth variant.

    Equivalence: ``compute()`` is **byte-identical** to
    ``compute_classification_metrics(full_logits, top_k)`` on the hand-rolled path, because every
    metric is a per-row reduction (``argmax`` / ``topk`` hit / strict-``>`` rank) or an additive
    per-class count. Two documented exceptions, neither reachable from the current call sites:
    at ``k <= 1`` the full path omits ``top{k}_acc``/``ndcg_{k}`` while this one emits them, and
    at ``N == 0`` the full path returns a zeros dict while ``compute()`` raises on ``torch.cat``
    of an empty list (guard the empty-loader case at the call site, as ``mtl_eval`` does). Batching cannot change a per-row quantity, so batch size is irrelevant to the
    result. Pinned by ``tests/test_tracking/test_streaming_cls_metrics.py``, which also carries
    the pre-refactor inline loops verbatim as golden references.

    Two INDEPENDENT device knobs, because the existing callers genuinely differ and collapsing
    them into one flag would silently change behaviour:

    * ``move_logits_to`` — where the per-row ops RUN. ``None`` keeps them on the logits' device.
      Setting ``"cpu"`` moves each batch's logits before reducing (p1's default, which preserves
      the CPU-scored path every banked reg cell used). This is the one knob that is **not**
      bit-identical across settings: ``topk``'s tie-break at the k-boundary is a kernel detail.
      Measured on real region logits: 0 boundary ties in 100 448 rows and a worst cross-device
      delta of 5.96e-08, but use ``diagnose_ties`` rather than assuming it.
    ``hits_from_rank`` is the DEFAULT (2026-08-10). It removes ``topk`` from the scoring path:
    ``hit@k == (rank <= k)`` whenever no row is ambiguous, which is an integer comparison and is
    therefore the same on CPU and CUDA — unlike ``topk``, whose tie-break is a kernel detail. That
    is what let the val metric move back onto the GPU, which is worth more than the arithmetic it
    saves: the per-batch ``logits.to("cpu")`` it replaces was synchronising the host every
    iteration and serialising the GPU (measured: removing it cut 6.4 s from a wall whose scoring
    was only 2.87 s). Pass ``hits_from_rank=False`` for the historical topk semantics.

    * ``store_on`` — where the tiny ``[N]`` accumulators are KEPT. ``"cpu"`` reduces on the GPU
      and parks the results in host memory (mtl_cv's S1 behaviour). Pure memory placement: moving
      an int64 rank vector between devices cannot change its value.

    ``diagnose_ties`` counts, per k, the rows whose reported hit@k is genuinely AMBIGUOUS — the
    only condition under which the tie-break (and therefore ``move_logits_to``, or any change to
    how top-k is obtained) can alter a reported number. A row is ambiguous iff the target sits in
    a tie group straddling the k boundary::

        n_gt < k < n_gt + n_eq        n_gt = #{strictly greater}, n_eq = #{equal, incl. target}

    An earlier version counted instead how often the k-th and (k+1)-th LOGITS were equal, which
    is a different and much larger set: a tie between two non-target classes cannot change any
    reported number. Measured on 4096x6553 with mildly-rounded logits, that version fired on
    48-62 rows while the true ambiguous count — and the observed divergence — were both **0**;
    with heavy ties it fired on all 4096 rows against 90 truly ambiguous and 1 actually divergent.
    A gate that over-reports by three orders of magnitude will veto changes that are provably
    safe, which is exactly what it did.

    Cost: ``n_gt`` is already known (``rank - 1``), so this adds ONE equality pass over the batch
    rather than the ``topk(max_k + 1)`` the old version needed.
